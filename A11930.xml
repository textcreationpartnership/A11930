            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">The marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age between the King and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter.</note>
               <hi>THE</hi> King tooke the daughter of the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> to wife: the whiche all men ſayd was a great occaſion to further the peace. The marriage was celebrated with great royaltie, and the newe Queene was receyued of the men on both partes with great ioy, as the happie beginning of fyrme and conſtant peace: and fame oppoſed hir gentle nature and diſpoſition, againſt the troubleſome and churliſh inclination of the Queene mother: &amp; men were in great doubt it would come to paſſe that the king for the fauour and liking that hee had of his newe wife, whome he was ſayde to loue entierly, would growe in diſlike of the Queene mother, whoſe nature he could not brooke long before, ſaying that he neyther woulde nor could beare any longer hir imperious ambition.</p>
            <p>The common cuſtome of humane affayres brought a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall credit to this reporte, that the newe Miſtreſſe and Lady ſhould put the olde dame quite out of fauour. Herevnto were added the forces of domeſticall reaſons. The King had two brethren, the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> of whome we haue ſpoken often times before: &amp; the Duke of <hi>Engoleſme.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> was more in fauour with his mother, and had gotten to hym ſelfe a name, and ſingular credit among the nobles, both by his ſeruice in the warres, and alſo by his happy ſucceſſe in the ſame: beſyde alſo the honor whyche the Catholiques gaue vnto him, who had him in more eſtimation almoſt than the King him ſelfe: in ſomuch that hee receyued a yeerely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of two hundred thouſande Frankes of the Cleargie, vppon condition to bee the patrone and defender of the Churche.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> beeing thus plentifully mayntayned,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17727:6"/> the King his brother (as it is credibly reported) had hym in ſuſpition:<note place="margin">Hartburning betweene the King and the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iou.</hi>
               </note> and that it appeared manifeſtly by euident ſpeeches and deedes that the King bare priuie grudge againſte hys brother. Alſo that the King ſayd, that hee would not be wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with newe troubles of warres: and that of late they of the Religion had bin falſely accuſed vnto him. On the contrary part, the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſhewed hym ſelfe an enemie to thoſe of the Religion: boaſted of hys victories ouer them: dyd hurt them by all meanes that he could: fauoured thoſe whom the Kyng hated, and hated thoſe whome the Kyng loued. Thus it euidently appeared, that there was enmitie betweene thoſe two brethren, in ſomuch that it ſeemed neceſſary for the King, to defende hym ſelfe agaynſt hys brothers power, leaſt bee ſhould begin any new trouble, and to diminiſhe the authoritie of hys mother whiche had continued ouer long, thereby to winne to hym ſelfe the hartes of thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: for that it was more for his ſafetie to truſt vnto the ayd and ſtrength of them of the Religion, than to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catholiques. Theſe kindes of reaſons ſtooke in the mindes of wiſe men, mouing them to thinke that the King woulde encline to peace, and alſo ſeeke to winne vnto him thoſe of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the quite contrary was prouided for, by ſo great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility and craft of the Queene mother, who beeing the chiefe workmiſtreſſe of theſe deceyts, made the King the chiefe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and inſtrument of them. The King trauayled to bring this one thing eſpecially to paſſe, that he might throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and certifie the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> &amp; the Admirall (by whoſe counſayles al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affayres of thoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) of his aſſured good will, both to obſerue &amp; keepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace, and alſo to defend them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo they might truſt vnto him. The ſubtill means &amp; practiſes whiche he vſed to bring this thing to paſſe, we haue ſhewed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .x. boke.

It is wonderful y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after ſo many experiments of treſon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Admiral being of a pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wit, &amp; hauing experi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence of great maters, could not beware of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubtil deceits of a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17727:7"/> and a yong man: when as he him ſelfe often times ſayde, that he ſuſpected the craftie wit of the Queene.</p>
            <p>About this time letters came from the Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (as we haue ſayde in the tenth Booke) to ſhewe their glad mindes for the peace concluded to whome the King wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne of his willingneſſe to eſtabliſh the ſame.</p>

               <hi>NEVERTHELESSE</hi> the Catholiques coulde not temper and ſtay them ſelues in certayne places. At <hi>Orange</hi> there was committed a great ſlaughter,<note place="margin">Murder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> vppon thoſe of the Religion.</note> notwithſtanding that the King had made warrantiſe of the contrary to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> For all they of the Religion whiche were fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in time of the former warre, were returned thyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne vppon truſt and warrant of the Kings Edict: vppon whome, they miſtruſting no ſuch thing, the ſouldiers beeyng let into the towne, fell with violence, the towneſmen whyche were Catholiques, ſetting them a worke, and aſſiſting them, ſo that they ſlue without all pitie or mercy a great number of men, women and children. Notwithſtanding, the Kyngs garriſon, whiche as yet remayned in the Caſtell, was a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for many, the whiche if it had not ſuppreſſed the rage of the people, a greater number of the Religious had bin ſlayne.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> vrged the Kyng, to yeeld vnto him <hi>Orange</hi> and the reſt of the dominion, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he did at the laſt: <hi>monſ.

            <p>After the which, commaundement was gyuen in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces name, that the men of both partes ſhoulde liue euer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards peaceably, according to the tenor of the Edict, and that the vſe of both Religions ſhould be free. Thoſe whiche were giltie of the murder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, at the firſte ſtale away for feare of puniſhment, notwithſtanding being at the laſt perſwaded both with the words and ſufferance of <hi>monſ.

Berchon</hi> wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſſembled the loue which he bare vnto the Religion, in ſomuch that he would not come to the ſermons of the ſame, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17727:7"/> though he fauoured the Catholiques. Thus the authors of the murder being allured to <hi>Orenge</hi> agayne, were at the laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and put to death.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time alſo certayne of the reformed Church of <hi>Rhoane</hi> were put to deathe by the common people:<note place="margin">Murder at <hi>Roane.</hi>
               </note> and in diuers other places alſo murders were committed agaynſte the Edict.</p>
            <p>Herevpon the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> the Princes, and other of the Peeres, ſent <hi>Briquemald, Teligni, La Noe,</hi> and <hi>Cauaignes,</hi> whiche were noble and wiſe men, to the King, to complayne to his maieſtie of theſe violations of the Edict, and to require reformation of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The King very louingly receyued them, declaring howe great greefe the hearing of theſe things was vnto him: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great othes, according to his cuſtome, promiſed that hee would ſo puniſh the breakers of his Edict, that they ſhould be an example to all others. Therefore at the kings commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement certayne of the chiefe of the Senate of <hi>Paris</hi> were ſent out of hand to <hi>Rhoane,</hi> to ſyt vppon that murder, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the offenders according to lawe. Marſhall <hi>Momorencie</hi> alſo receyued charge concerning this matter. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the greateſt part of thoſe murderers fled away at the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor hereof. Therefore many of their goodes were confiſcate: and three hundred of thoſe whiche were abſent were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to dye: alſo certayne of the raſcall ſort were hanged.</p>
            <p>After this certayne men were put in commiſſion, to ſee if there were any thing committed againſte the Edict in any part of the Realme: to heare alſo the complaints of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifes, and to ſatiſfye them according to the fourme of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. But theſe commiſſioners, euen as they had done afore time, vſed onely in ſtede of iuſtice and equitie, a counterfayte and outward ſhew of lawe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IN</hi> a certayne village of the territorie of <hi>Valentz</hi> called <hi>Monboch,</hi> a certayne yong man of the Religion, of honeſt parentage, found by chaunce in a mans houſe veſtments and Coapes for Maſſe. Theſe in ieſt and deriſion he put vpon him,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17727:8"/> running vp and downe the ſtreetes, making a ieſt and ſcorne of Popiſhe rytes. He being accuſed for this to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, was apprehended, and kept in cloſe pryſon for certaine dayes: and afterwards a great fine being ſet vpon his fathers heade, he was adiudged to the Galley: the which puniſhment in Fraunce, belongeth vnto vagabunds and theeues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THEY</hi> of the Religion had a great ſumme of money to paye for the wages of the <hi>Reiſters,</hi> to whome a large ſumme was yet due: the ſureties for the which were the Princes, the <hi>Admirall,</hi> Countie <hi>Rochfoucault,</hi> and certaine of the principall nobles: ſome part the king had payde. For the payment of this ſum, a great tribute was layd vpon thoſe of the religion, namely, that euery one ſhould paye towarde this ſumme, the fifth part of his reuenues, vntill the ſame were fully payde and diſcharged. For the gathering whereof, there were certayne Collectours appoynted by the kings letters in euery prouince, notwithſtanding, with the appeale of the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and of the Princes.</p>
            <p>This burthen, after ſo great ſpoyle &amp; waſte made by wars, ſeemed too many to be very great, in ſo much, that it kept backe a great many of thoſe whiche had profeſſed the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, from comming into the congregation. Notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding the greater part of them of the religion, gladly payde that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, vpon hope of peace, and for the deſire they had to enioy the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Beſides this tribute, there were other ſubſidies alſo to be payd to the king, the greatneſſe whereof, foreyne nations would ſcarce beleue.<note place="margin">Subſidies and taxes.</note> For there is no Chriſtian nation vnder the ſunne, that beareth the burthen of ſo many ſubſidies and taxes, as doth the realme of Fraunce, whereby incredible ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are gathered. Neuertheleſſe, theſe ſubſidies were payde with great willingneſſe of mynde, that within fewe moneths great treaſure came vnto the king. Beſides theſe charges, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Church was to maynteine their miniſters, and to prouide for other neceſſities.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the places appoynted for holy aſſemblies and preachings of the worde, were verie inconuenient.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17727:8"/> Therefore it is wonderfull, that the Churches ſtoode amidſt ſo many ſtumbling blockes and inconueniences. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, great was the number of them of the Religion in euery place, growing and increaſing, notwithſtanding theſe extremities.</p>

            <p>The report heereof was no doubt, verie acceptable to the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and to hir ſonne: notwithſtanding it is ſayd, that the <hi>Admirall</hi> at the firſt had this motion in ſuſpition, who going with <hi>Theligni</hi> to the Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> about this matter, the ſaid <hi>Theligni</hi> ſhewing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings good wil expreſſed at large, both towards the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and alſo toward the <hi>Admiral</hi> him ſelf, is ſayd to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend in word greatly againſt the ſame. Notwithſtanding, letters being often ſent concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the dayly ſpeach of the king, the <hi>Admirals</hi> mynd began by little and little to be perſuaded, and to iudge very well of the king in all things, thinking that a yong man which was of a milde nature and a louer of peace, coulde not diſſemble: and although he feared the ſubtile and craftie wit of the Queene mother, neuertheleſſe the matter was come to that poynt, that the king woulde not hearken to hir counſelles, in diſpyght of his brother the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> whoſe power he had greatly in ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>It is ſayd alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17727:9"/> &amp; dayly talked with him about ſecret matters of priuie cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel: For there is an olde and continuall hatred (as we haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſayd) betweene the houſes of <hi>Momorencie</hi> &amp; of <hi>Guiſe:</hi> in ſomuch that <hi>Momorencie</hi> thought, that not onely the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals death but his alſo was ſought: and that for thys cauſe he was alwayes ſuſpected and out of fauour with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Guiſes</hi> therefore ſeemed dayly more and more to be out of fauour with the King: contrariwiſe, he ſeemed to vſe the King familiarly: and proteſted his ſingular good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Admiral: alſo he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with him about waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires, for the exployting whereof, he ſayd he had neede of the help and ayde of the Admirall.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> chiefe and greateſt buſines was about the mariage: the contracte whereof could not be made without the preſence of the Queene of <hi>Nauar.</hi> The King &amp; Queene by all meanes vttered their good willes: The mynde of the Queene of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar</hi> was throughly perſwaded of the ſame: they diſagreed not aboute the dowry: For a large dowry meete for ſuche a State was offered: and the Queene mother was very careful for the beſtowing of hir only daughter, ſhee making a ſhewe as though ſhe would ſpare nothing to further the ſame.</p>
            <p>Many things were handled concernyng the contracte of matrimony: concerning the auncient ſocietie and frendſhip betwene the houſe of <hi>Valoys,</hi> of <hi>Borbon,</hi> and of <hi>Aubeter:</hi> and very notable things were at large ſpoken on both partes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reſtoring of the kingdome into his former ſtate by the meane of a fyrme peace.</p>
            <p>There remained two doubts, which ſeemed to trouble both partes, namely the reſpecte of contrary religion: and the place where the mariage ſhould be celebrated.

            <p>The King ſaid that he would not haue the manner of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mariages altered, which were wont to be celebrated there: and the rather bicauſe the ſame did greatly make for the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſigne of peace, when the ſame ſhould be ſeene to be openly celebrated in the Metropolitane citie of the realme, as it were in the face of the whole worlde. And now although both partes were perſwaded, that this maryage might bee made very profitably, yet notwithſtandyng there was great doubt concernyng the manner of celebratyng the mariage. The Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> beyng zelouſly addicted to the reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, would in no wyſe conſent that the maryage ſhould bee celebrated after the Romiſh faſhion: neyther the Queene mother would condiſcend that they ſhould bee maryed after the order of the reformed Religion. Thus there was greate diſſention betweene the two women, whereas they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed of the principall matter.</p>
            <p>The King at the fyrſt intreated the Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> to graunt vnto him and to his ſiſter this libertie: for that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayned to his dignitie, that the forme of the auncient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which he had receyued from his auncetors might bee vſed in the mariage of his ſiſter. When the Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> had conſtantly excuſed hir ſelfe, and that the King perceiued he preuayled nothing at all, it is reported, that vſing his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med othes, he ſayd that he would ſet his ſiſter at libertie from the lawes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and alſo from the rytes of the Religion: and that hee him ſelfe would celebrate the mariage, than the which there could not be a more pompous celebration. The which rumor was ſpred abroad among the Courtiers, and this new imagination pleaſed many very well: for whatſoeuer the King ſaith or doth, that doth the Frenchman lyke, inſomuche that they frame both their ſpeach and their apparell according to the Kings guiſe.</p>
            <p>To remooue this doubte reſpite was taken on eyther parte. The Kyng ſente letters vnto Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fyfth, to obtayne lycence for hys Syſter to marry with <hi>Henry Borbon</hi> hys Cooſyne, leaſte the reſpecte eyther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17727:11"/> of conſanguinitie or of Religion might hinder the mariage:<note place="margin">Lycence to marry ſent for to Rome.</note> for that it was for the wealth of the Realme: Furthermore that it would pleaſe his holines to giue them leaue to vſe ſuch rytes in celebrating matrimonie as might beſt ſerue theyr turne.</p>
            <p>The Pope altogether miſliketh of the Kings requeſt, the which he often tymes denyed to graunt, affyrming the ſame to be moſt vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>On the other parte alſo the Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the miniſters of the reformed Religion, what might be done in this matter. Of the which diuers verdictes and iudgementes were giuen. Some vrging the ſimplicitie of the word of god, thought it wicked by any manner of meanes to contracte ſuch matrimonie, the which was therefore muche more daungerous in noble perſonages, bicauſe the affayres in hand did not belong to one houſe alone, but alſo almoſt to the whole Realme. The which ſpeaches notwithſtanding were not gracious and acceptable to the Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> and to the reſt of the nobles, perſwading themſelues that they ſhould all generally receyue great profite by that maryage. Therefore the matter was committed to a fewe, by whoſe determination the ſame was to be ended: and they concluded nothing but that which they knew would pleaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> &amp; the nobles. Then the matter being approued vppon their ſentence &amp; determination, began to grow in greater like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; to pleaſe more of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters, whoſe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward required in publique aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches of <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the woorſer counſaile tooke place, and not only the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> but alſo the greateſt part of them of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, earneſtly wiſhed that mariage. All the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie ſtood on this poynte, by what way moſt conueniently and with leſt offence of eyther parte the mariage might be ſolemnized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Admirals wyfe being dead, hee maryed another of the noble houſe of <hi>Royen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Admiral marrieth his ſecond wife.</note> being daughter to the Countie of <hi>Entremont,</hi> and heyre to greate poſſeſſions. This ſtocke belongeth to the Countie of <hi>Sauoy:</hi> and thys riche no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17727:11"/> woman, was deſired in maryage of many noble men and peeres alſo of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall preuayled both by the meanes of the Kings letters to <hi>Philibert</hi> Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> (whoſe authoritie was greate in makyng that noble maryage) and alſo by his owne fame and name of Religion, which was moſt acceptable to that heroicall Lady: and ſo tooke hir to his wife, which many ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to bee an argument of moſt fyrme peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Admirall thought it neceſſarie for the expedition of the affayres in the lowe countrey, to enter into league with Elizabeth the Queenes maieſtie of Englande. And good occaſion (as he thought) was offered, for that hir maieſtie is ſingle, and the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> the Kings brother wanted a wyfe. The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> thought him ſelfe woorthy ſo great a maryage, both for that hee was the Kyngs brother, and alſo bicauſe he had wonne to him ſelfe great renowne and prayſe, by his valiant actes in martiall affayres.</p>
            <p>The charge to bring this matter to paſſe was committed to <hi>M. Momorencie,</hi> a wiſe man, and one of the chiefe nobles and gouernours of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ende declared the cauſes of this league: both that by this practiſe the myndes of the Admirall and of all the reſt which ought neceſſarily to be blynded for the better finiſhing of the wicked facte, might be deceyued: all the whole matter being cloked with prouident care for the diſpatche into the lowe countrey: and alſo that <hi>Momorencie</hi> a man of ſharpe wit myght not through hys familiaritie and conference with the Kyng ſmell out the counſailes of the tragedy which was in hande: and finally that England being bounde by the name of this league, might not ſtirre as offended at the wickednes of the facte, the which alſo came to paſſe. Theſe were the reaſons why the league was made with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queenes maieſtie of Englande, as hath ſince appeared by the ſucceſſe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AVTVMNE</hi> of this preſent yeere was very vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, flowing with continuall &amp; vehement ſhowers of rayne. A
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17727:12"/> great parte of the houſes and buildings of <hi>Feraria</hi> fell downe, to the preſent ruine of the whole Citie. Nere vnto <hi>Geneua</hi> at the ſtraytes of <hi>Ecluſe,</hi> a great parte of a hyll was broken down with the freat and violence of the waters, and fel down into the Riuer of <hi>Roſne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Floudes of water.</note> with the which the water was ſo ſtopte that it dyd ouerflowe: and the ſayd Ryuer was ſo checkte with the floude, that the ſtreame hauyng hys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe backewarde, cauſed the wheeles of thoſe milles that ſtoode vppon the ſame to runne amiſſe, and to turne the Milſtones the wrong waye: to the woonder of ſuche as ſawe the ſame, the lyke whereof was neuer ſeene before. There was alſo ſo greate an Earthquake in a certayne vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage neere vnto <hi>Geneua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An erthquake</note> that all the houſes in the ſame were ouerthrowne: and a certayne peece of grounde belonging to the fame, was remoued out of his place, and houſes that were ſtrongly builte, and trees alſo that were greate and talle, were ouerthrowne. Alſo the Suburbes of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> called <hi>Aguilot,</hi> was almoſt quyte ouerthrowen with this vyolence of waters, and the greateſte parte alſo of the ſtonewoorke of the Brydge vppon the Riuer of <hi>Roſne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An armie was prepared to goe to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and to the famous hauens of <hi>Broages</hi> the charge whereof was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Monſ. Strozzi,</hi> and to <hi>Baron d'Guarde.</hi> The ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor concerning the warre to come encreaſed more and more, euen as fame is woont to preuent things to come. But it was giuen out that thys warre ſhould bee in the lowe countrey. Therefore the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors made often complaints vnto the King, as though by his maieſties commaundement warre ſhould haue bene taken in hande againſt the Kyng of <hi>Spaine</hi> his ſoueraigne. But the Kyng excuſed him ſelfe with wonderfull diſſimulation, inſomuche that they of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by ſo doubtfull an aunſwere deemed that the Kyngs mynde was fully perſwaded concerning the warre of the low countrey.</p>
            <p>About the ſame tyme alſo <hi>Lodowic Naſsau</hi> brother to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17727:12"/> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> came to the Courte accompanying the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and entred into league with the Kyng in his brothers name, the ſame being ſubſcribed and ſealed.</p>
            <p>At ſuch tyme as the Nauie was preparing in the Occean Sea,<note place="margin">Anno. M.D. LXXII.</note> appointed with ſix thouſand footmen and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of peeces: there went a common ieſte abroade, that the Nauie went into the Iſle of <hi>Florida</hi> to fetch golde, but in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed the ſimpler ſorte of the commen people ſayde, that this preparation was not only by the Kings ſufferance, but alſo by his expreſſe commaundement, for the lowe countrey. This preparation pleaſed the moſte parte of the people very well: and all men of both partes, were ready to ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame warre, with ſo good will, as if they had neuer felte the calamities of warre. On the other parte, a great number of Catholiques and of thoſe of the Religion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng as they were ioyned together by affinitie and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, went to another warre, namely into <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the Turke, againſt whom he ſeeking to winne the Iſle of <hi>Malta,</hi> they bended their whole force &amp; power. Therefore men went thither with a great trayne of noble men of <hi>France,</hi> among which <hi>Marques d'Menie</hi> brother to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was one.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the greater parte went to the warre of the lowe countrey, Captaynes being ſent into all parts of the Realme, to gather ſuch Soldiers as would ſerue in that war of their owne accorde, and their wages was payde them out of the Kings treaſurie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> delay of this mariage ſeemed to be very long to all men, but eſpecially to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which looked for &amp; deſired the ſame, the cauſe whereof was made the Popes prohibition, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings letters oftentimes ſent for licence and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to the Cardinal <hi>Alexandrin,</hi> for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> fyrſt day of <hi>May</hi> in thys preſent yeare, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fyfth dyed, the which offered hope to the King (as he ſayd) to obtayn of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Pope licence to ende y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> plainly ſhewed hir ſelfe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17727:13"/> not to regarde any ſuche lycence, for the which cauſe were made ſo many delayes: and ſhee complayned hereof often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vnto the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SHORTLY</hi> after, the Popes death being noyſed, the King commaunded the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> to be preſent (as it was reported) at the Popes election. The King ſayd that hee had giuen him in charge to procure the Popes diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that once at the laſt that mariage might bee finiſhed.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall promiſing faithfully to accompliſhe the Kings commaundement concerning the Pope, altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Courte, ſeemed in the iudgement of the wyſer ſorte, beſyde common reportes, to prouide for his owne ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, leaſt he him ſelfe ſhould bee in daunger in ſo great fauour of them of the Religion, or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proclayming of a new war.</p>
            <p>All which things were ſo handeled by the craftie dealing of the Queene mother, the King alſo framing both his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and alſo his ſpeach accordingly, that euen the moſte fine wittes in the courte, thought that there was nothing but truth ment.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A Synode at Niſmes.</note>
               <hi>IN</hi> the moneth of <hi>May</hi> there was a <hi>Synode</hi> at a noble Citie in <hi>Languedoc</hi> called <hi>Niſmes,</hi> of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. To thys <hi>Synode,</hi> by the benefite of the Kyngs letters, came the Miniſters and choſen men of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches from all partes of the Realme. The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was moued concernyng eccleſiaſticall doctrine. At this <hi>Synode</hi> were preſent <hi>Theodore de Beza, Anthonius Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeus, Nicolaus Gelazius,</hi> and dyuers other learned and famous men. <hi>Gelazius</hi> was choſen to bee the moderator of this <hi>Synode.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THERE</hi> was at this tyme a great famyne in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> and about the Sea coaſt,<note place="margin">Famine in Languedoc.</note> being of it ſelfe a very fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoyle: and it continued ſo ſore, that dead bodyes ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with hunger laye in the ſtreetes. For thys cauſe the <hi>Synode</hi> brake vp theyr ſittyng at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted a vacation, bothe for that victualles wanted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17727:13"/> to ſerue ſo great a multitude, and alſo to prouide for the poorer ſort, leaſt they ſhould be at charge for lawe matters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> peace which men nowe more largely enioyed, had almoſt loſed the reynes of al libertie, in ſo much, that he which now profeſſed the Religion, ſeemed to differ nothing at all, neyther in ſpeache nor in manners from the Catholike. And now there beganne to be a great famine of the word of God: mens myndes being annoyed with tedious curioſitie, and in many alſo of luke warme zeale, in ſuche wiſe, that a great number of thoſe of the Religion, could nowe ſcarſely abyde to heare a Sermon of ordinarie doctrine, as not eloquent and courtly inough. Thus by peace and eaſe, things commonly waxe worſe and worſe. Is it then any maruell, if the Church be oftentimes afflicted and ouerwhelmed with troubles and calamities, when it abuſeth peace, and the happy ſucceſſe of things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THERE</hi> is vpon the ſea coaſt of Flaunders a citie called <hi>Vliſhing,</hi> ſtanding verie conueniently for trafike and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Andwerpe.</hi> The towneſmen of this citie being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the crueltie of the Spaniards, ſlue the Lieftenant which was ſet by the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> to kepe the towne, and certaine of his garrizon, and tooke the citie. And when the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> ſent a newe ſupply to recouer the towne, they valiantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and ſet them ſelues at libertie. By their example many cities of the lowe countrey were incouraged: and the noble townes of Zeland and Holland, were ſayde to fauour the Prince of <hi>Aurenge,</hi> and to deſire libertie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> being poyſoned to death with a payre of perfumed gloues (as is ſayde in the tenth booke) the King, Queene, and the whole court ſeemed to take hir death very grieuouſly. The King to put away all ſuſpition of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, commaunded that the dead body ſhould be ript vp by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and ſo the cauſes of hir death found out. The phiſitions taking a viewe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, reported that ſhe dyed of a pleuriſie: the more ſecret cauſe, which was the poyſoning of the brayne, being not found, for that they did not ſearch the head. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17727:14"/> to ſtop the rumour, hir death was ſpread abroade in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike writings and billes. Hir body was caryed to <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> and there ſumptuouſly buryed, according to the maner of the religion. The King and Queene to declare their ſorow and griefe, put on mourning weed, and commaunded all the court to doe the lyke. The Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> being thus deade, the King ſo dealt with hir ſonne Henrie, with the Admirall, and with the reſt of the noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the religion that hir death ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haſten forward the marriage. Therefore within fewe dayes, the mourning for the Queene of <hi>Nauar</hi> was layde aſide in the court. The King practized another ſubtletie, to appoint the day of marriage, for the which, ſo many delayes had bene hitherto made. He ſayd oftentimes to the Prince of <hi>Nauar</hi> and to the Admiral, that this time was differred by a certaine ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious care of his mother, of his ſiſter, and of the Cardinal of <hi>Borbon,</hi> who mynded to marry them, looking for the Popes diſpenſation, by which they were to haue leaue to marry. He fayned therfore, that he had receyued letters from Rome from his Ambaſſadour, by which he gaue them to vnderſtande, that the cardinal of <hi>Lorhain</hi> by his diligence had obtained y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes diſpenſation, which he would ſend with al ſpeede poſſible: and that he had ſent him worde hereof out of hande, that the King might not thinke the ſame long a comming. Therefore the King ſhewed theſe letters vnto his mother, to his ſiſter, and to the Cardinall of <hi>Borbon.</hi> The Queene reioyced, and ſayde that the ſame was ſufficient, to ende the matter (euen as if ſhe had not knowne that they were fayned letters, and that there was no impediment nowe, but that the marriage might be ſolemnized. Therfore it was agreed by conſent on eyther part, that the marriage day ſhould be the .xviiij. of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> towne of <hi>Mountes</hi> was beſieged by the duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Lodowic Naſſau</hi> was in the town, with a great number of the nobilitie of Fraunce. <hi>M.

But the duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> hauing priuie intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of <hi>M. Genlis</hi> (of the which

Alſo <hi>monſieur Genlis</hi> and <hi>La Noe,</hi> generalles of that armie, were taken pryſoners. The rumour of this ouerthrowe ſeemed to be verie grieuous vnto the Kyng, and to the whole Court. And by and by the King ſent his letters vnto <hi>monſ.

               <hi>Monducet</hi> did the kings Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage diligently to the Duke of <hi>Alba.</hi> The Admiral being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified of theſe commaundementes of the king, and alſo of the diligence of <hi>Monducet</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perſuaded of the kings faythfull meaning, to take warre in hande: whome he heard oftentimes to ſay; that he woulde one day be reuenged on the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> and on the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes. In the meane time, the king gaue commiſſion to the Admirall to leuie a newe armie, that with a freſhe ſupply of ſouldiers, he might ſuccour the beſieged.</p>
            <p>The myndes of them of the religion were greatly ioyous, bicauſe of the marriage at hand. Notwithſtanding, pitiful ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours went abrode dayly: which they for the moſt part wold in no wiſe beleue, conſtruing al things to the beſt.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certaine that many wiſe men,<note place="margin">An admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Admirall.</note> after the death of the Queene of <hi>Nauar,</hi> ſuſpected that there was ſome fraude co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured vnder the pretence of matrimony, and that the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit was ſpecially practized to inſnare the Admirall. And it is certainly true, that the Admiral was oftentimes admoniſhed, both by wordes, and alſo by letters, not to aduenture him ſelfe in ſo great an aſſembly, and that too within the walles of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, where the <hi>Guiſes</hi> were in great fauour and eſtimation.</p>
            <p>And amongſt other admonitions, one deliuered vnto him a book the ſumme &amp; ſcope wherof was this. Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that this is a decree of the Catholikes confirmed by authoritie, <hi>That there is no faith to be kept with Heretikes:</hi> by which name they of the religion are ſpecially called. Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that there is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17727:15"/> hatred, kindled againſt thoſe of the religion, by the enuie of the former warres: ſo that there is no doubt, but that the ful purpoſe and intent of the Queene is, to deſtroy by all manner of means thoſe of the Religion. That an Italyan woman, of the Popes progenie, and of a ſubtile and craftie wit, can not but ſeke all extremities againſt hir enimies, conſider in what ſchole the king hath bin trayned and brought vp: that for this 12. yeeres ſpace, he hath learned of his ſcholemaſters, to ſweare, to blaſpheme, to forſweare, to ioyne him ſelf with whoores and harlots, to diſſemble his fayth, his religion, and his thoughtes, to chaunge and frame his countenaunce, and to reioyce in bloud: that he might ſuffer his ſubiects to be ſlaine like beaſts. Thou knoweſt that the King is perſuaded in the doctrine of <hi>Machiauel,</hi> howe that he ought not to ſuffer in his realme any other religion than that, vpon the which his ſtate ſtandeth: and that he hath often learned this, that it is not poſſible for his kingdome to be quiet, ſo long as there are two religions at once in the ſame. And it is certaine, that hatred is planted in the kings mind being a yong man, and he hath bin often times perſuaded by falſe argumentes, that they of the religion haue gone about to ſpoile him both of his kingdome, and alſo of his life. Thou art deceyued, if that thou thinke that the king, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch prince as he is, will at any time ſuffer thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects which ſhall by warre riſe againſt him, though vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer ſo iuſt a cauſe to vſe and enioy the benefite of his lawes. But be thou rather perſuaded of this, that this is naturally ingraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the myndes of kings and princes to reuenge that by force of armes, which is done againſt them by like force. And that a Kyng and Princes will freely breake thoſe couenants, which they haue made eyther for feare, or for neceſſitie, ſo ſoone as thoſe cauſes ſhall ceaſſe. And that they holde this for a lawe, That thoſe conditions which the Prince hath made with the ſubiectes, ought not to be kepte, ſpecially when he made them in warre: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth ought to be broken for the kyngdoms ſake: That they make no conſcience to deceyue the ſubiectes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of a ſolemne othe.</p>

That in ſtead of the Armie whyche was committed to the conduct of <hi>Monſ. Genlis,</hi> a newe ſupply was prepared: that the affayres of the lowe countrey were in good cace. That the Kyngs Ambaſſadour dyd dayly aduertiſe hym of the counſayles of the Duke of <hi>Alba.</hi> That the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,

Finally, that the Kyng did all things with greate care, for the confirmation of peace, by the benefyte whereof, there was no doubt but that the affayres of the Religion ſhoulde haue good ſucceſſe. Wherefore hee prayed him and all others of the ſame opinion, that they woulde not trouble his mynde with thoſe ſuſpitions, beeyng occupied with better thynges: but rather that they woulde pray vnto GOD, that he woulde bryng that to good effect whyche was happyly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, to the peace and tranquillitie of the Realme and hys Churche.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hauing gotten a great armie, in the which were ſayd to be twenty thouſand footemen, &amp; eyght thouſand horſemen, entred the lowe countrey.

            <p>
               <hi>AFTER</hi> the murder, the king commaunded the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to come before him. Who being in his preſence, he ſayeth vnto them, That after ſo long time of warres, by which his kingdome hath bin greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged, he hath found out at the length vndoubted reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to take away cleane all the cauſes of warre, and hathe therefore commaunded the Admirall to be ſlayne, the wicked author of miſcheuous troubles, and that the ſame puniſhment was prouided in the Citie for al lewde and naughtie perſons, infected with vngodly ſuperſtition. That he remembred what great harme he had receyued both of the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and alſo of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who were the Captaynes and ringleaders of deſperate perſons, and ſeditiouſly helde warre againſt him: to reuenge ſo greate iniuries he had nowe cauſe and occaſion offered him. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he ſayd he would forgiue matters paſt and done for their ages and conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſake: deeming that they were not ſo much to be blamed as the Admirall and other moſte miſcheuous perſons theyr counſaylers, who eyther already had bin puniſhed for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes, or elſe were now vnder the ſame. Theſe thyngs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayd he would pardon, vpon condition that they wold euer after amend their former faultes with more faythfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and woulde returne to the Religion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique fayth, that hauing renounced the doctrine of prophane ſuperſtition, whiche had already cauſed ſo great troubles and warres, they woulde wholly imbrace the auncient Religion, and returne to the lap of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That he would euer after haue but one onely Religion imbraced in hys Realme, and the ſame which he had receyued from hys aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetors. Therefore he willed them to conſider whether they would obay in theſe things, or elſe ſuffer ſuch puniſhmente as theyr fellowes had done.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Nauar</hi> being abaſhed with theſe ſharpe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, aunſweared humbly vnto the king, that hee remembred
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17727:17"/> his fayth, and the conſanguinitie lately entred with hys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: and that he would do thoſe things whiche might pleaſe and content his minde: moſt hartily beſeeching him to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how great a thing a mans conſcience is, and how hardly he could renounce that Religion, whiche he had learned, and in the which he had bin trayned vp from a childe. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he ſpake theſe things with great ſubmiſſion &amp; feare.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> perceyuing the preſent perill, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King, but not without feare of mind, that his maieſtie had ſo ſolemnly giuen his faith to him and to the reſt of the Religion, that he could not perſwade him ſelfe, that he would breake ſo faithfull an oath, nor harken to the counſailes of his aduerſaries. And as touching y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> obedience which his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie required of him, and which he had euer hitherto faythfully ſhewed to the ſame, he minded neuer to forſake it during life. But as touching the Religion, he had free leaue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king to exerciſe the ſame, and from God the true knowledge therof, to whom he knew he ſhuld giue an account for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Adding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ſelfe and all that he had was in the kings power. And he willed him to do what ſoeuer pleaſed him both with his life and alſo with his goodes: yet neuertheleſſe he was fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined neuer to depart from that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he knew for certain to be true, though it were to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſent perill of his life.</p>
            <p>The King was ſore offended with this aunſweare of the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> and calling him obſtinate, ſeditious, and the ſonne of a ſeditious perſon, telleth him that if he do not repent him within three dayes, he ſhould ſuffer death for his peruerſe obſtinacie.</p>
            <p>There were ſpared alſo certayne of the houſhold ſeruantes of the king of <hi>Nauar</hi> which were gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>monſ. Grammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, Duraſe</hi> and certayne others, which promiſed that they woulde do, whatſoeuer the king commaunded them. Theſe being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer earneſt louers of the Religion were pardoned, that they might be inſtruments afterward to withſtand the ſame.</p>
            <p>This garboyle and bloudy ſturre being thus made in the Citie and in the Caſtell, there were left as yet thoſe whyche
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17727:18"/> dwelt and aboade in the ſuburbes,<note place="margin">Mongomerie eſcapeth with others by flight.</note> and ſome of the nobilitie, as <hi>M. Chartres, Mongomeri, Briquemauld, Bellouez, Fontene,</hi> and diuers other noble men.</p>
            <p>Commaundement was giuen by the king to the Prouoſt of the marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to haue a thouſand armed men in a redineſſe to intercept thoſe of the religion whiche were in the ſuburbes of <hi>Sangerman.</hi> And hee had giuen the whole charge of this matter vnto <hi>M. Marcell</hi> one of the chiefe Magiſtrates of the citie. Notwithſtanding the prepared ſouldiours came not at the hour apointed, through the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>The king had appointed <hi>M. Mongeron</hi> chiefe ouerſeer of the execution of his purpoſe. He looking for his ſouldiors, and ſeeking for the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to complayne to him of this matter, certaine houres were ſpente.</p>
            <p>In the meane tyme, one of the Religion ſeing the citie all on a roare, running vnto the riuer, got in conuenient time a boate, and ſo cut ouer the riuer, and certified <hi>Mongomerie</hi> of the trouble in the citie. This was about fiue of the clocke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mongomerie</hi> gaue <hi>M. Chartres</hi> to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hereof: and ſo by opening the matter from one to an other, it was generally knowne by and by to all that were in the village or ſuburbes. Notwithſtanding it ſeemed almoſt incredible. The greateſt part beleued that the king was not priuie to ſo great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo farre they were from thinking that it ſhould be don by his commaundement: otherſome beyng as yet perſuaded of the kings good will, thought that the kings owne perſon was aſſaulted by the <hi>Guyſes,</hi> for the hatred that they bare to the Religion, whiche he ſeemed to fauour.</p>
            <p>Therfore amidſt this varietie of opinions, they knew not themſelues what waye they were beſt to take. Some thought it beſte to goe oute of hande to the kyng to the Caſtell of <hi>Lowre,</hi> leaſt they myght be deceyued of the kynges will: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome ſayde, that it was needfull and neceſſarie for them to goe and ayde the kyng: The thyrde and wyſer ſorte, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting but that this was doone by the kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, betooke them to flight.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:17727:18"/>
            <p>But while they made delay, they might eaſily haue bin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, had not an other impediment happened.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſeeing that he coulde not haue a band of ſouldiours of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> they following the praye and ſpoyle, deuiſed a newe way, whiche was, that he woulde goe himſelfe with certaine ſouldiours to the ſuburbes of <hi>Sanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whyle the ſhot and ſpearemen of the kings garde gaue an aſſault from the riuer vpon the whiche ſtoode the ſuburbes, ouer againſt the caſtell of <hi>Lowre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his purpoſe and deuiſe tooke not effecte. For when the <hi>Guiſe</hi> woulde haue gone foorth with his ſouldiours, he was conſtrayned to ſtaye, the porter of the gates hauing deliuered the wrong keys, the other not to be founde. Before therefore the keyes coulde be brought, ſuche delay was made, that <hi>M. Chartres, Mongomerie,</hi> and others eſcaped away, and yet not without further perill. For they ſawe on the other ſyde of the ſhoare bandes of ſouldiours approching to ſhippe, and hearde cryes made from the Caſtell, that they fledde: and ſawe alſo greate ſtoare of ſhotte diſcharged at them, bothe from the Caſtell, and alſo from the ſhippes. Alſo it is ſayde, that the kyng hym ſelfe, ſtoode vpon the top of his tower, crying and ſwearyng, and diſchargyng ſhotte. Then they whiche were in the ſuburbes, leauyng all theyr goodes, roade away without bootes and ſpurres, wyth as muche ſpeede as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they coulde. They were ſcarſe out of ſighte when the ſouldiours were landed on the other ſyde, who brake into the houſes, and tooke their pray. Neuertheleſſe they whiche fled, were purſued by the <hi>Guyſe,</hi> by Duke <hi>d'Aumale,</hi> by the Earle of <hi>Engoleſme,</hi> and others to <hi>Monfort,</hi> which is diſtant from <hi>Paris</hi> the ſpace of eyght leagues. Wherevpon he returning belayed the countrey, that ſuche as fledde awaye mighte bee taken. Thus certayne of the noble menne of the Religion were preſerued.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Lorde <hi>Aſsier, monſ. Sanroman, Cugier,</hi> and dyuers other noble men and Gentlemen, were ſaued by the <hi>Guyſes</hi> meanes: To thys ende and purpoſe, to laye all the enuye
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17727:19"/> and blame vpon the king and people, as though it had bin hys only purpoſe to reuenge his owne priuate ſpight vppon the Admiral, and alſo that they whome he had ſaued in ſo greate peril, might for euer by ſuch a benefite be bound vnto him: the which in deede came to paſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Munday following, whiche was the .xxv. daye of Auguſt, the Sunne ſhined very bright and cleere. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the king looking out of his windowe of the <hi>Lower,</hi> cryed with oathes that the fayre day did reioyce for the ſlaughter of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> Thus alſo ſayd other of the court: And <hi>Iames Carpenter</hi> by a publique bill called this bright day, the lyghte of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>About noone in the Churchyarde of Saint Innocent there, ſprang vp a bremble buſhe, which the Frenchmen call white thorne, contrary to the time and ſeaſon of the yeere. Of the which when the people heard, they ran thither in greate num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to ſee this ſtraunge miracle, the like whereof hathe not bin ſeene. Some ſay that this was made to growe by the practiſe of a certaine Prieſt, whiche is not vnlyke. But the common people ſayd, that God by a manifeſt ſigne did approoue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lately committed: and that nowe both the Catholique fayth, and alſo the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce</hi> had recouered theyr former glory, and ſhoulde after this triumphantly flouriſhe. Therefore the trumpets ſounded in diuers places of the citie. Notwithſtanding it is certayne, that the like kind of white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne or hauthorne, ſprang vp about the ſame time in other places alſo: whether it were long of the temperateneſſe of the ſeaſon or no, I knowe not. Many ſeriouſly alluding to the names of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things, affirmed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the white thorne ſproong vp to the commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Innocents, &amp; not to approoue the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, bycauſe it floriſhed in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place which had to name S.

But if ſo we mark this miracle, what other thing doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſignifie vnto vs tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, That albeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church ſeemed by this deadly wound to be quite ſlain, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it ſhould come to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it being reuiued by a certaine ſingular &amp; extraordinarie power, ſhould flouriſh, &amp; ſhuld firmely ſtand
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17727:19"/> amidſt theſe ouerthrowes. It is not farre vnlike the myracles ſhewed to Moyſes in the buſhe, the which though it were ſet on fire, was not conſumed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> King and the Queene determined by their priuie counſell, to haue this murther proceede againſt other cities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thereby mynding to deſtroy vtterly them of the Religion, leaſt <hi>monſ. Momorencie,</hi> by their helpe and ayde, ſhoulde take in hande any newe enterpriſe. He at this time was gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to <hi>Inſuladam,</hi> a towne of his dominion. <hi>D'Anuil</hi> was at Paris, who with the reſt of his brethren, had drunke of the ſame cup with the Admirall, if they might haue bene brought altogether within the compaſſe of the ſame ſnare. But it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not a ſure and ſafe way to kyll one, and to leaue the reſte of the brethren aliue no ſo great power, of the houſe and ſtocke of <hi>Momorencie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thurſday folowing, being the eight and twentie of Auguſt, the King commaunded a Iubile, and a generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion about the citie, in the which he in his own perſon, with the reſt of the Court was preſent, to giue God thankes openly as they ſayd, bycauſe their enterpriſe had ſuch deſired ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the King cauſed it to be openly publiſhed, that he was the authour of that murther, forbidding the vſe of the reformed religion throughout his whole realme, vntill he had taken other order: notwithſtanding, he ſayd that he wold not haue theſe things ſo to be taken, as though his Edictes of pacification were broken.

            <p>The which things, howe well they doe hang together, all men may ſee. The King ſayth heere, that he would haue the former Edictes of pacification ſtande in force: and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, forbiddeth holy ſermons and other aſſemblies, vpon payne of death. He affirmeth, that he would haue all men to liue in peace and ſecuritie at home: and yet notwithſtanding, he playnely teſtifieth him ſelfe to be the authour of murthers. And as touching the conſpiracie made by the Admirall, and the reſt which were at <hi>Paris,</hi> they themſelues, which take part with the Catholikes, do ſcorne it as a forged lye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GREAT</hi> murthers were committed at <hi>Lions,</hi> and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other cities: ſo that within one monethes ſpace, there were at the leaſt three thouſande men ſlaine: But of all the reſt, the wicked and cruell murther, committed in the citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the kings preſence, exceeded and farre paſſed the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> al gouernors of prouinces obeyed not thoſe bloudy commaundements, giuen by the king. The Countie <hi>d'Tende,</hi> anſwered the kings commaundement, and his letters ſealed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17727:20"/> with his priuie ſeale, ſaying: That he did not thinke this to be the kings deede, but the deede of ſuch as forged and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his name, for that a fewe dayes before, hee had receyued quite contrarie commaundements by the kings letters. And he affirmed that he would obey thoſe firſt letters, as meete and worthy to proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a king, &amp; woulde fulfil the ſame as the kings vndoubted commaundement. As for the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement (ſayth he) it ſeemeth ſo cruell and barbarous, that he would not obey the king if he were preſent to commaunde the ſame. Notwithſtanding, this Countie <hi>d'Tende,</hi> fought ſtoutly in the former warre, againſt thoſe of the Religion.</p>
            <p>He which brought theſe letters and this bloudy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to Countie <hi>d'Tende,</hi> was called <hi>monſ. d'Mole,</hi> a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman borne in <hi>Arles,</hi> who within one yere after, was behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Paris</hi> by the kings commaundement.</p>
            <p>Countie <hi>d'Tende,</hi> within few dayes after being at <hi>Auinion,</hi> was by ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings appoyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t poyſoned to death, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>de Retz</hi> being appointed to ſucceed him. <hi>Mons. Santhera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> gouernour of <hi>Auuergne</hi> anſwered to the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wold not obey contrary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, being coloured and cloaked vnder the kings name: affirming therfore, that he wold ſatiſfie the firſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two, for that it agreed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings dignitie, &amp; with his Edicts, &amp; that he was no hangman, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings lieftena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to gouern y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings ſubiects w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> equitie &amp; peace.</p>
            <p>The ninth day of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, the king being troubled with a ſodaine feare, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his armour to be brought, and the captaines of his guard to come vnto him: he ſweareth that he hath determined to deſtroy thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remained of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: willing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go euery man to his charge, for he would firſt beginne with the prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> Then the Queene his wife intreated him, that he woulde not raſhly take in hande a matter of ſo great waight. The king being perſuaded by the earneſt beſeeching of his wife, laide aſide his armour, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht his guard. The day folowing he called before him the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and offered vnto him three things, of the which he willed him to choſe one: that is to ſay, Maſſe Death,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17727:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> or perpetuall impryſonment. To this choyce the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> anſwered, that by the ayde and aſſyſtance of God, he would neuer choſe the firſte: and that he left the other two to the Kings will and pleaſure. But at the laſt he was by the meanes of one <hi>Rozarius,</hi> a Miniſter ſometime of the reformed Church of <hi>Orleans,</hi> drawne to that abiuration, the copy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſet down in the tenth booke of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries. By the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile perſuaſions I ſay of this man, he did fall away from the truth, and openly renounced the Religion, and went to the Maſſe, and to other rytes of the Romiſhe Church.</p>
            <p>Thus by the example of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> many whiche were accounted of the Religion, fell from the ſame. And the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſolemnly ſet forth their defection, by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. For when they had renounced the Religion at Paris, they ſent letters vnto the Pope, in the which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that to their great ſorowe and griefe, they haue bene drawne away from the felowſhip of the Church by that falſe doctrine, euen from their childhoode, the blame whereof they layde not vpon their parentes, but vpon thoſe wicked men whiche had ſeduced them. Notwithſtanding, they ſayde it was come to paſſe in good time through the goodneſſe of God, that they ſhuld acknowledge their errour, and ſeriouſly deteſt the ſame in mynd. Therfore they humbly beſeeched the Pope, as a father to forgiue them their former offences, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them againe into the boſome of the Church, and they would ſhewe euer after all ſuch obedience, as became reuerent children to ſhewe: and that it woulde pleaſe him to certifie them by his letters, whereby their conſciences might be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of pardon graunted.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Pope ſent his pardon to the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> and to the King of <hi>Nauar,</hi> that they might not onely fight vnder his banner, but alſo might be at continuall warre with the reformed religion: ſuch was the calamitie of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>After this, the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> made an Edicte concerning them of <hi>Bearne,</hi> concerning the aboliſhing of the reformed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17727:21"/> Religion. By the commaundement of the Queene of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> his mother, when ſhe was aliue, the ſtates of <hi>Bearne</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelues togither to take order co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning religion, and by the free conſent of the ſtates, the Maſſe was abrogated throughout all the dominion of <hi>Bearne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thither the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſent <hi>Monſ. Grammont</hi> wyth authoritie to preferre the Edict, by whiche he forbade all that were within his dominion to vſe the reformed religion: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he gaue leaue vnto them of the Religion to ſell away their lande, and to prouide for themſelues in the ſpace of one yeare, and then to go whither ſoeuer they would.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Pope hearing of theſe murthers, went himſelf with his whole Colledge of Cardinals, firſt of all to the Church of S. Marke, and gaue verie large thankes vnto God. Then the next day after, he celebrated a ſolemne Maſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded a Iubile. Thankes were giuen to God for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the enimies of the truth, and of the Churche in the realme of Fraunce: for the victorie gotten againſt the Turks: and alſo prayer was made for the kingdome of <hi>Polonia,</hi> that the king might proue ſuche a one as woulde ſeriouſly defende and mainteine the Catholike religion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euening there was a tryumpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t peale of Gunnes in the Caſtell of <hi>Santangell,</hi> and the French men which were in the Citie made dyuerſe ioyfull bankets in many places of the ſame: as though nowe after ſo long contentions, a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt were made, and the euerlaſting peace and tranquilitie of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gotten.</p>
            <p>The French men had alſo a generall proceſſion aboute the Citie: in the which the Pope was preſent with his whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals, and a great number of diſhes according to the cuſtome were caryed in the ſame. A Cardinal alſo ſang Maſſe in the Churche of S. <hi>Lodowic,</hi> where were a greate multitude of people aſſembled togither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THERE</hi> were alſo about this time diuerſe things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both in French and in Latine, to commend the handling of that murther. <hi>Antonius Muretus</hi> made an oration at <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:17727:22"/> in commendation of the king, and when he had done, cauſed the ſame to be publiſhed, commending the king for his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and conſtant minde, and alſo for his excellent wiſedome,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pibrachus</hi> ſet forth an Epiſtle, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he maketh a very ſubtile diſcourſe of al this hyſtorie, to make the Admiral guilty of treaſon, and the cauſe of the Religious hatefull. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he pretended the loue of religion, the whiche in tyme paſt he both knewe and had profeſſed, and had afterwarde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured the ſame.</p>
            <p>There was alſo an other Epiſtle ſpredde abroade of <hi>Peter Carpenter</hi> of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> a lawier, who being a counterfeyt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the religion, ſpake euill of the Admiral, &amp; of the whole cauſe: The which Epiſtle was anſwered by one <hi>Franciſcus Portus,</hi> a godly man, and expert in the Greeke tongue. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amidſt the tragical mournings of them of the Religion, theſe were the triumphes of the Catholikes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> king alſo celebrated the order of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> which was a feaſt dedicated to thoſe noble men whiche were of the order, who bare about them the order of S. <hi>Michael</hi> fighting with the diuel. At this feaſt were many noble men: and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the reſt, the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> xxvij. day of October, the Senate of Paris pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a ſore ſentence agaynſt the Admirall being dead, and agaynſt his memorie and children. He was condemned as one guiltie of treaſon: as an enimie to peace, and a common trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler of the ſtate: as the authour of a conſpiracie agaynſt the king, and againſt the ſtate. His memorie was condemned to euerlaſting ignominie. And to the ende there might remaine ſome monument of thoſe faults, it was decreed that his bodie if it could be found, ſhould be drawne through euery ſtreete of the citie, after it had ſtood in the Market place foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie houres, and if the ſame could not be found, then his Image ſhould be made ſtuft with ſtraw, and ſo be drawne in ſtead of the ſame as aforeſayd, and ſo to the place of execution called the Forkes of <hi>Montfalcon.</hi> It was alſo decreed that his Armes, Creſt, and Shield, ſhould be drawne in like maner to the fore
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17727:22"/> named place: And that in what places ſoeuer they were found, they ſhould be broken downe by the hangman as a token of his euerlaſting ignominie. Alſo that all his goodes that either he or his aunceters had receyued by the benefite and liberalitie of kings, whether they were moueable or immoueable, ſhould come vnto the crowne. His children were pronounced vnno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and baſe, and vnworthie to haue anye publike office, or to enioy their goodes, which if they had any within the Realme, they were confiſcate to the king. His chiefe houſe <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> was beaten downe to the ground, that neuer any thing might be buylded there againe: The trees of the Orcharde were cut downe, and the Gardens about the ſayde houſe turned vpſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe: and it was decreed that a braſen pyller ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected where the houſe did ſtande, with this decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the ſame.</p>
            <p>It was alſo decreed that the xxiiij, of Auguſt euery yeare, there ſhoulde be a generall proceſſion about the Citie, to giue thankes vnto God, and to celebrate the memorie of that day, in the which that cruel murder was committed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AMIDST</hi> theſe troubles, many of the Religion whiche ſought to prouide for the ſafegard of their conſcience and life, fled into forraine nations. Some into <hi>Englande, Germanie, Strausburge,</hi> and <hi>Heidelberge:</hi> alſo otherſominto <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to <hi>Baſile,</hi> and to the townes of <hi>Berne,</hi> to <hi>Lauſanna,</hi> and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities: and the greateſt parte to <hi>Geneua.</hi> Alſo <hi>Rochel, Mountauban, Niſmes,</hi> and certaine Cities in the Countrey of <hi>Viuaretz,</hi> and <hi>Seuenatz,</hi> were left as places of refuge, as wee will declare hereafter.</p>
            <p>The two ſonnes of the Admiral by the ſingular prouidence of God eſcaped imminent deſtruction, and the Countie <hi>Laual</hi> the ſonne of <hi>D'andelot,</hi> with the daughter of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall which was <hi>Thelignies</hi> widow, came to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> after that to <hi>Berne,</hi> and tarying cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine monethes at <hi>Baſil,</hi> they returned to <hi>Berne</hi> againe, being very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly enterteyned of the people.</p>

But to returne to our purpoſe agayne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THEREFORE,</hi> this fourth warre is more wonderfull than the three firſt, bycauſe of moſt weake and feeble beginnings it had greater and more notable ſucceſſe: in ſo much that when the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Admirall, and other noble men wyth helpe and ayde from forreyne Princes, tooke part, no ſuche wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy effectes enſued: the reaſon and grounde of the cauſe neuer more euidently ſhyned, from out of the deepe pit of extreme ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, without any ayde of ſtrangers, and wythout the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of greater helpes, than it ſhall appeare by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of this hiſtorie. This then was the Kyngs ſtate, and this was the cace of them of the Religion, after that butcherly murther committed on Saint Bartholmewes day, being the foure and twentie of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>For (as we haue ſayde) that ſmall remnant of them of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were brought to this exigent, that ſeeing them ſelues far vnequall to matche with the Kings power, they were ready of their owne accorde to yeelde them ſelues into his hande. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, when they ſawe that murthers were committed vpon them of the Religion, with no leſſe crueltie than before, in dyuers cities, all they which were in the Kyngs power, and in the danger of the Catholiques, beganne to loke about them, and at the length to deuiſe ſome honeſt way, whereby they myght defende them ſelues. So that in the deepe deſperation of all thyngs ſeruing for neceſſary defence, deſperation founde out a way, and a ſure and certayne perſuaſion to bring the ſame to effecte, ſupplyed moſt effectuall reaſons of defence in this confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and nakedneſſe. The happy defence of Rochell, dyd not a lyttle incourage the myndes of other men, to fyrme and valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant conſtancie. Fyrſt of all therefore we wyll begynne with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17727:26"/> Rochell: and then we wyll ſpeake ſeuerally of the reſt in order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MONSIEVR Stroſsi,</hi> and the Lorde <hi>de Guarde,</hi> recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued charge to take Rochell, and we haue oftentimes ſayde,<note place="margin">Pollicie vſed to take Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell.</note> that a nauy of ſhippes was prouided there already to the ſame end. They then goe about to get in their ſouldiers into Rochell, ſometyme vnder the coloure to buy marchandiſe, and ſometime vnder the colour of viſiting theyr frindes. Notwithſtandyng, they of Rochell were alway vigilant and warie: and hearyng of the cruell murther committed at <hi>Paris,</hi> cauſed more dilygent watche and warde to be kept. In the meane tyme, <hi>monſieur Stroſsi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>de Guarde,</hi> vrged them of Rochell, with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Kyngs letters, both to receyue into the towne the Kyngs garriſon, and alſo to gyue vnto them great plentie of victuals to furnyſh their ſhippes.</p>
            <p>This they of Rochell, denyed and withſtoode, that the nauy myght departe from thence: affyrming that they dyd nothing agaynſt their dutie and auncient pryuiledges, by whiche they were exempted from al garriſons, ſauyng from that which they ſhould leuie within their owne citie, and wherby they had leaue to defende them ſelues by force of Armes, and that they coulde not ſpare any of their prouiſion of victuals.</p>
            <p>Then they which were for the Kyng, founde fault with the towneſmen of Rochel, bycauſe many came vnto them from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers partes of the realme, and were receyued into the citie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let. To this they of the towne anſwered, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no ſtrangers, but onely the inhabitantes of the realme, whiche came about their affayres and marchandiſe, the whiche was nothyng contrarie eyther to their office or cuſtome, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Kyngs ſouldiers had leaue to come into the citie.</p>
            <p>They were alſo required by the Liefetenant of <hi>Guian, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Monpaz</hi> which was their neighbour, not to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues obſtinat &amp; wilful, in refuſing to receiue the kings gariſon, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that the king was carefull for their ſafetie, and that therefore he dyd ſo prouide for them: and that it was not lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he woulde bryng any detryment or dammage to hys Cyties: alſo that hee had iuſtly punyſhed the wyckedneſſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17727:27"/> of Rebelles by the ſlaughter at <hi>Paris:</hi> not minding continually to be ſeuere againſt his ſubiects. Therefore he affyrmed that it was more for their ſafetie to deſerue the Kings fauour by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>There came certayne noble men of the Religion to <hi>Rochell</hi> from thoſe places whiche were neareſt adioyning therevnto, as from the territories of <hi>Santonge, Onic, Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Lymoſin,</hi> which ſought the ſafetie of their life: there came alſo about theſe fyrſt beginnings, about fiue and fiftie Paſtors or Miniſters of Churches: and of the common ſort of people about a thouſande and fyue hundred ſouldiers, out of dyuers parts of the Realme, and many which were eſcaped from the ſlaughter of <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> King had gyuen commandement to <hi>Monſieur Biron</hi> a noble man to gouerne <hi>Rochel:</hi> who (as we haue ſayd before) had taken great paynes in the former warres, about the intreatie of peace.

            <p>Strait after this came <hi>Monſieur Audenarz</hi> a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo, in the Kings name, with very large letters of the Kings in the which the king exhorted them to ſhewe theyr obedience, giuing them to vnderſtande that hee determined in his minde nothyng more, than to keepe and defende them in their houſes in peace and ſafetie, vnder the gard &amp; warrant of his Edictes: requiring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17727:27"/> them herevpon to acknowledge him to be a true and faythfull interpreter of his owne minde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur Audenarz</hi> being admitted into the Senat of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> perſwaded very much to this ende and purpoſe, certifying them of the ſingular good will of the king towardes them.

                  <p>WE the Gentlemen, Captaynes, Burgeſes, and others now being in the towne of <hi>Rochel,</hi> doe giue anſwere to ſuch commaundements as are giuen to vs in the name of hys Maieſtie, that we cannot acknowledge that the ſame which is ſignified vnto vs, and the publiſhing of the proclamation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred at our handes, doe proceede from his Maieſtie.

            <p>
               <hi>MONSIEVR Biron</hi> aunſwereth them agayne, that he was very ſory that they were bent to that which would bryng theyr owne deſtruction: yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng he ſayd he would hyde the matter from the kyng by ſpeciall excuſes, vntill ſuche tyme as they had aduiſed themſelues better: willyng them not to hurte themſelues by this daungerous determination, and to beware leaſt theyr raſhe wilfulneſſe turned them to diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Finally he promyſed that he would endeuour hymſelfe all that he coulde to perſwade the kyng that the Nauie might be diſmiſt and ſent ſome otherway.</p>

            <p>By reaſon of theſe delayes of the kyng, occaſion was giuen to them of <hi>Rochel</hi> to caſt away feare, and to take vnto them better courage: whereas if the kyng had ſet vpon them with all his force at the firſt brunte of the murder, theyr ouerthrow had bene the more lykely.</p>

            <p>Captayne <hi>Mirambel</hi> tolde <hi>monſieur Leuger</hi> that there was an eaſie way made for hym to take the citie: in ſo much, that he ſhould onely neede to approche ſomewhat nearer the citie, with ſome ambuſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of ſouldiers, &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng to the gates of the citie, he ſhould be let in by hym, promyſing ſo to order the matter, and to appoynt ſuch warders about the gates, that he ſhould eaſily haue his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur Leuger</hi> preparing his ſouldiers out of hand, drew neare to the citye, and came with a troupe of horſmen vnto the gates: gaue <hi>monſieur Mirambel</hi> to vnderſtande, that he was come thyther with the kings power, commaunding him vpon his allegeance to ſet open the gates vnto him. There at that time <hi>monſieur Biron</hi> walked before the gates vnarmed, with certayne of the chiefe towneſmen: him all amazed <hi>monſieur Leuger</hi> ſaluted, at hys ſo ſudden co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vpon them. <hi>Monſieur Mirebel</hi> commaunded the gates of the citie to be ſet open: and <hi>monſ.

            <p>Amydſt theſe ſalutations, the Catholiques, and they of the Relygion fleeyng together vnto him, <hi>monſieur Biron</hi> ſtale away priuyly, and came to the next towne by, called <hi>Mirebel,</hi> which was by the Kings Edict an appoynted place, to receiue the holy aſſemblyes of the profeſſours of the Religion of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneufe,</hi> and tolde to <hi>monſ.

            <p>
               <hi>Monſ. Leuger</hi> at the firſt, intreated the chiefe of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion very gentlely: ſeeking to perſuade them that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17727:34"/> was to gouerne them wyth peace and equitie, vnder the protection of the Kyngs Edicts, and to trouble no mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. In the tyme of this truce, many that profeſſed the Relygion, ſtale awaye to <hi>Mirebel,</hi> and fortyfyed the ſame out of hande. By the meanes heereof, <hi>Villeneufe</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde recouered (as we wyll declare heereafter) dyd great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly further the affayres of the Relygious in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Of the whiche I ſpeake particularly, that men may vnderſtande and ſee, of howe weake and ſmall begynnings, the affayres of the Religion grewe and tooke ſo good ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>The inhabitantes of <hi>Aubenac</hi> and <hi>Priuac,</hi> followed the counſell of the cytizens of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> concernyng the wayes of defence.

For this cauſe the Conſulles of <hi>Aubenac,</hi> hauing obtayned truce at his handes, wente to <hi>Villeneufe,</hi> and payed the money required. Notwythſtanding, one of them beyng a verie honeſt and ryche Citizen, named <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and of the Religion alſo, was helde captyue by <hi>monſieur Leuger,</hi> againſt the lawe of Armes, for that he came vnder truſte, and was put alſo to his raunſome, euen as if hee had beene taken in battell, the whiche beyng payed, hee was helde captyue neuertheleſſe, vntyll ſuche time as <hi>Villeneufe,</hi> whiche they of the Relygion had taken, was delyuered vp to him, as wee will declare heereafter. Theſe experimentes of Catholique falſehoode, confyrmed the Relygious, as it were in obſtinate conſtancie, in ſo muche, that they choſe rather to ſuffer any thing, than to come into the handes of theyr falſe forſworne enimies. This was the ſtate of many places in <hi>Languedoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> bycauſe they of <hi>Niſmes</hi> were vrged oftentimes by the letters of <hi>monſ. Ioyeuſe,</hi> to abſtayne from holy Sermons, according to the forme of the kings Edict: left by that occaſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17727:35"/> they might be founde giltie before the king: after delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had of the matter, they determined for the preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not to haue Sermons in the day time, but in the night. It can not be expreſſed, howe muche weeping and lamentation the people made at that laſt Sermon. Yet neuertheleſſe, men came to the preaching of the worde more plentifully and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly than they dyd before: for the more that afflictions doe increaſe, the more precious is the word of God vnto the godly.</p>
            <p>The inhabitantes of <hi>Viuaretz</hi> and <hi>Seuenatz,</hi> folowed the example of the citizens of <hi>Niſmes:</hi> in thoſe cities whiche they helde, they had theyr Sermons in the night, the whiche not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, continued but for a fewe dayes.</p>

            <p>The citizens of <hi>Niſmes</hi> anſwered very copiouſly in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they coulde not receyue that garrizon, ſhewing the reaſons wherefore: not that they refuſed to obey the king, but that they myght prouide for the ſafetie of their life, and for the libertie of theyr conſcience: Bycauſe ſuch occaſions had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy falne out, as ſeriouſly required them to ſeeke the ſame at this time.

That they deſired nothing but peace and tranquillitie, and to ſhewe their obedience to the king. That if ſo be lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies might be prouided to take away theyr iuſt feare, they were ready to yeelde them ſelues into the handes of the kyng theyr Lorde and Prince. But if ſo be old treaſons and ſnares were practiſed, and if ſo be they could obtayne no more than they had obtayned in tyme paſt, they were ready to ſuffer all manner of extremitie, rather than that they would willingly caſt them ſelues vpon the cruell and bloudy ſwordes of ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling murtherers: for that it was great madneſſe, for any man
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17727:35"/> willyngly to caſt him ſelfe into peryll.

               <hi>THE</hi> kings Edict is publiſhed, to reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home again, which were fled away eyther into forreine nations, or elſe into thoſe cities, which they of the religion held. That (by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript of the kings Edict) pardon ſhuld be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for al things paſt,<note place="margin">The Kings Edict for the calling home of ſuche as were fled.</note> to ſuch as would returne home againe, with prouiſo for the ſafety of their life and conſcience, ſo that they woulde lyue peaceably at home. And in the ſame Edict, the king threatned thoſe that would not obey his commandement, to make their goods confiſcate, as if they were rebels. And he teſtified, that he did not puniſh the Admiral and his adherentes, to this end and purpoſe, that he might ſhewe ſeueritie for euer, vpon his ſubiectes of the newe opinion: (for ſo he called the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but rather to prouide a neceſſary remedy for the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred kyngdome, though the ſame in outward ſhewe ſeemed to be ſharpe. Alſo whereas many of his people through feare, were fled eyther into thoſe cities which the rebels held, or elſe into forrein nations, that he earneſtly lamented their caſe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a good maſter of a houſe, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they receiued ſo much hindrance &amp; loſſe, by being baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their houſes.

But if ſo be they would obſtinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſent them ſelues, and careleſly contemne his clemencie, then to be aſſured that he would be ſeuere in puniſhing them, according to their deſertes. Alſo excepte they appeared at the daye appoynted, that hee woulde confyſcate theyr goodes,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17727:37"/> to the end they myght knowe what it is to abuſe the clemencie of their prince: That he did offer and proclayme thys in time, leaſt any man ſhould ſuſtayne the puniſhment afterwarde for his preſumptuouſe boldneſſe and raſhneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thys was publiſhed the .xix. of Nouember. But howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the kyng by thoſe words of the Edict would ſeeme to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the conſciences of the Religious, it cannot be of any wayght or credit in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement of wiſe men. For a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many of the kings letters patents were ſente abroade tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out the Realme, by which moſt vniuſtly he conſtrained thoſe, which had not once ſet theyr foote out of the Realme, and whoſe condition for that cauſe ought to haue bin much better, to renounce the Religion, and to imbrace Papiſtrie.</p>
            <p>Many there imagined and coniectured that the great maſſe of money gathered out of the proſcription of the Religious, woulde bee ſufficiente to mayntayne warre, and ſo they of the Religion ſhould be wounded with their owne ſwordes.</p>
            <p>Therefore the goodes of the Religious were dayly vewed and put in inuentorie, the whiche is alwayes the beginning of Confiſcation, ſo that the goodes of the Religious beyng ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, were almoſt put in an Inuentorie, but yet were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate: the cauſe whereof was the contrary ſucceſſe whyche the Kyng looked not for.

            <p>Vnder the collour and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that Edict, the king ſought to bryng to paſſe by hys Legate <hi>monſ. Belleure,</hi>

            <p>They of <hi>Rochel</hi> held thoſe villages that bordered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr Citie, as <hi>Maraim, Moſe, Nouaille,</hi> whych were vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge of Captayne <hi>Norman,</hi> and <hi>Andiui,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> vnder the charge of Captayne <hi>Virolet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They determined not to abyde the force of ſo great an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but to make haſt vnto the Citie: notwithſtandyng Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <hi>Norman</hi> purpoſed firſt to aſſay the enimie.

            <p>Then <hi>Mon.

            <p>Notwithſtandyng <hi>Monſ. Fontene</hi> came to <hi>Coſne,</hi> a towne two leagues from <hi>Sanſerre,</hi> that from thence he myght the more conueniently proſecute hys buſineſſe. The Deputies alſo of <hi>Sanſerre,</hi> were returned from the Courte.</p>
            <p>Then contentions began to growe among the Citizens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the receyuyng of <hi>Monſieur Fontene.</hi> For the Deputies perſwaded with certaine of the chief citizens to receyue <hi>Monſ.

               <hi>Monſieur Fontene</hi> vnderſtandyng that he was moſt of all reſiſted by forreners to enter into the citie, wrote vnto them: affirmyng that there was no cauſe why he ſhould betray theyr ſafetie: but rather that he had a care for the ſame.

Therefore if they would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to go to any other place, he woulde bryng to paſſe that they ſhould be ſafeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted whether ſoeuer they would: for the faythful performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wherof he ſayd they ſhould haue pledges.</p>
            <p>The forreners ſent two Deputies to <hi>M.

            <p>Therfore that which could not be brought to paſſe by pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, was aſſayed by force.

In the which letters, he declareth that the king was not ſo vneaſie to be reconciled, and vnwilling to ſhewe grace, but that if they would repent them, and craue pardon at his handes, he would receyue them to his fauour againe: but if they did obſtinately refuſe hys grace, they myght aſſure them ſelues to feele the power and ſeueritie of their moſt renowmed Lord: &amp; could not impute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of that their deſtruction, to any other than to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. They of Rochell anſwered the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> wyth thankes giuing, beſeeching him to labour with the King, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myght be brought to aſſured peace and tranquilitie: &amp; that eſpecially they myght haue the libertie of their conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> fiftenth day of this month, the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> came with great authoritie and countenance into the kyngs campe, being accompanyed with his brother the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> whiche were of the kings bloud: the <hi>Guiſe,</hi> Duke <hi>D'Aumal, Marques d'Meyne,</hi> Duke <hi>d'Bouillon, Monluce,</hi> Count <hi>Rochfoucalt,</hi> the Lord <hi>Acier,</hi> who after the death of his brother, ſucceeded hym in the inheritance, and was called Duke <hi>D'Vzes,</hi> who hauing forſaken the religion, tooke parte with the catholikes. There were many other noble men alſo: &amp; there was ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of noble men, that to beſiege and aſſault one citie, men came from al parts of the realme, with al forces that might be poſſible. But before we come to ſpeake of the noble ſiege,<note place="margin">A topographi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>call deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rochell.</note> it ſeemeth neceſſarie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we make breef deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſituation of Rochel, &amp; of the moſt famous places, therein made notable by valiant exploytes.</p>
            <p>Rochel by ſituation, extendeth it ſelfe ſo farre into the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſea, that it is almoſt compaſſed about therewith:<note place="margin">Salte mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes. 16.</note> and it is cloſed almoſt rounde about with ſalte maryſhes, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the making of ſalte: but that part whiche tendeth towarde the countrey of <hi>Poictou,</hi> is fyrme and faſt grounde.

Many other fortes were reared, which are to be ſeene in the platforme belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to this diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Alſo it is to be noted, that the hauen called <hi>Chef de bois,</hi> where the Kings Nauie roade, is two myles diſtant from the gate of Rochell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> therefore being receyued with try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant peales of the great fielde peeces, went to <hi>Neullj</hi> to abyde there: where he tarryed the whole time of the ſiege, with the reſt of the Princes, and greateſt part of the nobles. The ſame day hee tooke a viewe of the walles of the Citie, and muſtred the Armie.</p>
            <p>The day folowyng, the towneſmen brake out at three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall places of the Citie, and hauyng ſlayne an hundred of their enimies, returned into the Citie agayne, with loſſe of a fewe of their men.</p>
            <p>Then was there a place appointed, from whence the walles of the citie might be conueniently battered, the batterie being layd to the gate of <hi>Cogney:</hi> and by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> a countermure was made, and fortified with hurdels to beare and defende the ſhot.</p>
            <p>Alſo he forgot not to practiſe ſubtily miſchief, vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of parley: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end the city might be aſſailed with two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, namely by outward force, &amp; by inward craft &amp; deceit. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citizens did not wel agree among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: ſome enclining to peace, of the which the duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> at that time had made an offer vnto them: others thinking it better to ſtand manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their own defence: ſaying, that the offered peace was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſnare to betray them, according to the olde maner.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Norman</hi> going to ſpoile &amp; rob with two galleys, toke a ſhip, laden with fifty tun of wine of <hi>Burdeux,</hi> and fiue
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17727:47"/> and twentie tunne of wheate, and returned with his men in ſafety into Rochell hauen, notwithſtanding that he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled by <hi>monſ. d' Guarde,</hi> wyth great force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> hauing taken a viewe of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke whiche bordered on the ſea coaſte, and mynding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into the Kyngs campe, ſent before hym two hundred horſemen, commaunding them to ſkyrmiſhe wyth the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that hee in the meane time might paſſe by, with the more ſafetie. Whyle theſe and certayne troupes of the towneſmen were in ſkyrmiſh at that place, certayne horſemen, ouer whom <hi>monſ. Grandriſe</hi> a noble man was captayne, carying behynde euery of them a foote man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Monſ.

            <p>
               <hi>SHORTLY</hi> after they of Rochell beyng dyuerſly ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, were contented at the length to parley wyth the Kyngs Lieftenants: <hi>monſ. l' Noe</hi> with <hi>Pierrez, Mortie,</hi> and <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſon,</hi> beyng choſen for this purpoſe, came into the Kyngs campe, and ſo entred into parley with <hi>monſ. Biron, Strozzi, Villequier,</hi> and <hi>Gadagne,</hi> and to this parley alſo came the Countie <hi>d' Retz,</hi> and at the length certayne of the chiefe towneſmen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GADAGNE</hi> hauyng ſpoken at large to <hi>monſ. l' Noe,</hi> and to hys felowes, of the ſingular good wyll of the Kyng, towardes them of Rochell, offered at the laſt to them in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the ſumme of thoſe conditions, vpon the which the King woulde come to compoſition of peace: the whiche conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were theſe: Fyrſt, that the inhabitants of Rochell, though they had grieuouſly offended his maieſtie, for that they beyng abaſhed with a certayne vayne feare, woulde not obey his commaundements oftentimes ſent vnto them, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding freely pardoned, ſo that they woulde receyue <hi>monſ. Biron</hi> into the citie, and would obey hym. Secondly, that he wold grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the free vſe of Relygion, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of the pacificatorie Edict, in the which he woulde haue
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17727:47"/> nothyng neyther diminiſhed nor altered: &amp; for thys he would make them moſt ample and large aſſurance. Thyrdly, that he would gyue vnto thoſe whiche woulde departe to any other place, full leaue and libertie to depart, and to carry theyr goodes whether ſoeuer they woulde, or otherwyſe to vſe them at theyr owne pleaſure.</p>
            <p>They which were deputed for Rochel, made anſwere, that they had hytherto in no poynt diſobeyed the kyng, but had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhewed themſelues hys faythfull ſubiectes. That, by the daungerous and troubleſome ſtate of the tyme they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to this neceſſarie defence of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, leaſt they ſhould fall into the handes and willes of theyr enimies as others had done, which had imbraced with them the ſame religion. That they deſired of the king this one thing, namely, that they might enioy the libertie of their conſciences by the benefite of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of peace. But ſeing the cauſe in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was not their alone, but belongyng alſo to the reſt of the reformed Churches, they alſo earneſtly requyred this thyng that conſideration of them might be had in like manner: Forſomuch as they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues without theyr co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent. And thus they parted.</p>
            <p>The day followyng, <hi>Monſ. l'Noe</hi> beyng beſet with ſixtene horſemen hauyng encountered and charged a greater troupe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Monſ. l Noe</hi> hardly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth death.</note> and was purſuyng the chaſe, was ſo neare hys death, that if a Captayne had not put hymſelfe betweene the enemie and <hi>l'Noe,</hi> he had bene ſlayne. But the Captayne thereby purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hys deaths wounde.</p>
            <p>The deputies of Rochel beyng returned into the citie, tolde the whole matter vnto the Senate. The Senate called before them the Paſtors of the Church, to haue theyr iudgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng theſe matters. The Paſtors anſweared, That for ſo much as they were demaunded of thoſe thyngs whiche ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belonged to conſcience and to Gods prerogatiue, it was a matter of great wayghte: and therefore that they ought not to make anſwere to the ſame, before they had craued wiſdome of God. Affirmyng that peace was to be wiſhed, but not ſuch a peace as ſhould be more perillous and mortall than warre:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17727:48"/> as might playnly inough appeare by thoſe former and late examples. That it was not likely that the kyng commyng vpon them with his whole power &amp; proclaiming open warre, would make conuenient and profitable conditions of peace: notwithſtandyng that they ought to endeuour themſelues to forſlow nothyng that might be for the peace of the Churches, ſeing they ſought not warre, but their needefull and neceſſarie defence. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that thoſe conferences &amp; parleys did not ſeeme to be ſafe and without peril: wherfore they thought it better to deale by wryting, whereby they might alſo haue a more conuenient meane to deliberate. Furthermore that they ought to haue a conſideration of the common vtilitie of all Churches, and that therfore they ought to do nothyng for their owne priuate cauſe, except the vſe of the ſame peace ſhoulde be extended to other Churches.</p>
            <p>The next day the people were called togither, that a finall determination might be made concernyng this matter. And the people lyked of that iudgement of the Paſtors, wherof we haue ſpoken euen now.</p>
            <p>This aſſembly was ſcarſe diſmiſte, when as the kyngs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was approched the gate of the citie, whiche ran forceably togither on a heape to breake open the ſame. Wherevpon they of the towne brake foorth and repulſed the kyngs power by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little: and ayde commyng ſtill on bothe partes, there was a ſore ſkyrmiſhe at that place, bothe ſides valiantly quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng themſelues. This ſkyrmiſhe continued verye whot the ſpace of ſire houres.<note place="margin">Another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte.</note> 
               <hi>Monſieur l'Noe</hi> was in great perill of his lyfe, his breſt plate beyng broken with diuers violent ſtrokes, and his horſe ſlayne vnder him. The ſpeedy commyng of the night ended this battayle. Of the towneſmen twelue were wantyng, and ſeuen and twentie were wounded. But of the kyngs parte there are ſayde to be a hundred and fiftie ſlayne. Wonderfull was the boldeneſſe and courage of the women in the middeſt of the fight, comming almoſt into the daunger of the conflict, bringyng to ſuche as were wounded wine and other comfortable things.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:17727:48"/>
            <p>The nexte day whiche was the laſt of Februarie, the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryng Cannon ſhot beganne to batter the walles and gate of <hi>Cogne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The kings ſouldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte.</note> Wherby the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultations of the diſagreyng townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were diſturbed, and conſtrayned they were by neceſſitie to defende themſelues.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the townſmen gaue an aſſault, hauing <hi>monſ. l'Noe,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> theyr Captaynes: at the whiche aſſaulte many on bothe partes were ſlayne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſ l'Noe</hi> contrary to the agreed and concluded determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, brought to paſſe, that the ſayd determination being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked in the publique aſſembly of the Senate and people, it was agreed that the kings Deputies ſhould be heard againe, that the matter might be rather ended by peace than by warre. Wherevpon <hi>Monſieur Strozzi</hi> and <hi>Mandreuille,</hi> were ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rochel</hi> for hoſtages. And <hi>Monſieur l'Noe,</hi> and <hi>Iames Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Mayre,</hi> came vnto the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> as it was agreed by the ſenate and people.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe the batterie proceeded agaynſt <hi>Cogne</hi> forte: whoſe fortification within fewe dayes were beaten downe.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> had hearde the Deputies of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> anſwered in the Kings name, that the kyng woulde adde nothyng vnto thoſe former conditions rehearſed vnto them already by <hi>Gadagne.</hi> That, if they were wiſe, they woulde imbrace them betymes whyle the kyngs grace and goodneſſe was offered vnto them: and not to preſume vppon vayne confidence to haue helpe and ayde out of Englande.</p>
            <p>With this anſweare they of <hi>Rochel</hi> returned to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte: and then came agayne to the Kyngs campe, requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng that bothe the Citie, and alſo the territorie of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> mighte haue one and the ſelfe ſame vſe of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: and alſo that the ſame benefite mighte belong to the reſte of the Churches diſperſed throughout the Realme. To the which Countie <hi>de Adretz,</hi> made anſwer that the kings pleaſure was to haue the Citie onely partaker of that benefite: as for the other Churches, that he woulde prouide for them at his owne pleaſure, and accordyng to hys wyſedome:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17727:49"/> willyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rochel to receyue the benefite offered, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the kyng would afterward graunt vnto theyr fellowes. This anſwere was not liked. The which being brought to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, they al agreed, that al wayes of defence lawful were to be ſought: &amp; that rather than they ſhould runne into preſent peril, they ought rather to prefer iuſt warre, than to imbrace reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſuſpected peace: for God would defende theyr cauſe.</p>
            <p>Whyle theſe things were in communication, the greate gunnes ſhooke and battered the walles of the towne. The townſmen alſo hauyng theyr peeces and ſhot well defenced with bulwarkes and rampyers, diſcharged luſtyly from the Citie, in ſomuch that many on the kyngs parte were at diuers tymes hurt and ſlayne. Among the reſte, from that forte which we ſayde is called <hi>l'Euangele,</hi> there was diſcharged a Canon ſhot, whiche runnyng through hardell trenche not ſufficiently fortified with earth,<note place="margin">Duke <hi>D'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall</hi> ſlayne.</note> ſlewe Duke <hi>d'Aumall</hi> as he ſtoode priuily behynde the ſame, beyng vncle by the fathers ſide to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> And ſo the funerall exequies of thys noble peere, was ioyned with the dayly ſlaughters of noble men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>Alwayes the thunderyng ſhot went off agaynſt the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men laboryng to repayre the breaches of theyr walles: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandyng to the ſmal hurte of the townſmen, buſily occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied there aboutes.</p>

Momorenci,</hi> brought vnto <hi>d'Anuil</hi> his kinſman two Enſignes of footemen <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coynes,</hi> who among the Frenchmen are accounted the moſt expert and painfull Soldiers. Theſe ſcorned the vaine labour of thoſe that followed the ſiege, and noted the conſtancie of the towne, with bragges what they would do more than their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes before them. Therefore <hi>monſieur Candale,</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked by his ſouldiers craued of <hi>Monſ. d'Anuil,</hi> that he and his bande might haue leaue to giue the firſt aſſaulte to the towne. His requeſt was graunted. And there was a ſufficient breache made in the wall of the towne. At the whiche when <hi>monſieur Candale</hi> aſſayed by fault to enter, he was ſo receyued that he was repulſed with loſſe of three hundred men at that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17727:50"/> aſſault. With this loſſe <hi>M. Candale</hi> was ſo angrie, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to <hi>d'Anuil</hi> that he abhorred the ciuil warres by whiche one Frenchman killed another, to ſerue and pleaſe the mindes of vile and naughtie knaues: for ſuch were his wordes.</p>
            <p>The daye folowing <hi>mon. Candale</hi> ſeeking to recouer the loſſe of his honor, was ſlain himſelfe: which greatly chafed and grieued his ſouldiers, but ſpecially <hi>d'Anuil,</hi> who was diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and defamed with that delay of warre, and vnhappie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and was ſayd by the Catholikes to delay and ſpende the time for the nonce to the kings great loſſe and detriment.</p>
            <p>For the whole houſe of <hi>Momorencie</hi> were appointed to be ſlaine with the Admiral their kinſman, in the ſlaughter of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: but what was the let hereof we haue ſhewed alreadye. Notwithſtanding the wyſer ſort affyrme, that <hi>d'Anuil</hi> by hys exployts in that warre of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſhewed himſelf forward to do al that he was able, that he might win the kings fauor.</p>
            <p>When there was no occaſion left to take <hi>Sommiron,</hi> and the kings armie lingring the ſiege, beholde <hi>mon. Gremian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth parley: and vpon notable conditions he agreed wyth <hi>dAnuil</hi> concerning the yeelding vp the towne, namely that al both ſouldiers and towneſmen, ſhoulde depart with their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and all their goodes in ſafetie, that they ſhould haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyt for ſeuen dayes, and that hoſtages ſhould be taken on ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, vntill the agreement were fully ended.</p>
            <p>Therefore the garriſon and towneſmen, hauing <hi>monſieur Gremian</hi> their captain, came forth of the citie armed with their families and goodes, and came in ſafetie to the next Cities of <hi>Seuenatz,</hi> the hoſtages abyding in the meane time at <hi>Niſmes.</hi> The yeelding vp of <hi>Sommiron</hi> ſeemed incredible to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sommiron</hi> yeelded vp, vpon good conditions.</note> which were without al hope to receyue the ſame: and to the diſhonor of <hi>d'Anuil</hi> they reported, that <hi>monſ. Gremian</hi> to gratifie <hi>d'Anuil,</hi> had willingly yeelded vp the Citie vnto him. Notwithſtanding in very deed <hi>Sommiron</hi> was brought into thoſe ſtrayts and extremities, that they wanting both vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail and alſo goonpowder, and hauing no ayde from their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes (who could ſcarcely helpe themſelues ſufficiently) could
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17727:50"/> not but yeeld vp the towne at that time.</p>
            <p>From thys tyme forwarde the Catholikes warred not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt them of the Religion in <hi>Languedoc:</hi> and the yeare following brought a wonderfull alteration, as we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ABOVT</hi> this time there befell a new occaſion to further the affayres of the Religious in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Concerning <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneufe,</hi> which was intercepted by <hi>mon. Leugere,</hi> we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before. The baniſhed Citizens of <hi>Villeneufe,</hi> vſed theſe meanes to recouer their citie. We ſayde before that a little towne called <hi>Mirebel,</hi> was taken by <hi>mon. Baron</hi> and <hi>Pradel:</hi> whether the moſt earneſt fauorers of the Religion of <hi>Villeneuf</hi> fled.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Villeneufe</hi> in the territorie of <hi>Viuaretz</hi> is taken by them of the Religion.</note> They therfore being in <hi>Mirebel</hi> which was ſituate vpon the higher ground, from whence they might ſee farre off, had alwayes <hi>Villeneufe</hi> before their eyes, inſomuch that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion was alwayes in the mindes of the poore baniſhed Citizens to recouer their countrey. Amidſt the ſtraytes of the ſiege of <hi>Sommiron,</hi> thoſe extremities of <hi>Mirebel</hi> are repeated, being beſieged round about with enimies.</p>
            <p>There came to <hi>mon. Pradel</hi> a certaine ſouldier a Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, which was newly come from <hi>Villeneufe:</hi> who affyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he had deuiſed a way to take the citie, in ſhewe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and fonde, but yet ſuch he ſayde, as was not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, being much more eaſie than that which was practiſed in taking of <hi>Niſmes</hi> in the time of the former warre.</p>
            <p>There was at the walles of <hi>Villeneufe</hi> a hole, out of the which the water of the towne, onely in the time of raine, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to purge the wayes and chanels: and the ſame had an y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron grate before it. That hole this Souldier had viewed, and reported the ſame to be ſuche, that the barres of iron might eaſily be broken vp: through the which he affyrmed they might eaſily paſſe into the towne.</p>
            <p>The matter beeing tolde to <hi>mon. Baron</hi> a Captaine, was ieaſted at. Notwithſtanding, at the inſtance of <hi>mon. Pradel,</hi> it was agreed that thys deuice ſhould be put in practiſe. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Baron</hi> was gone apart to <hi>Priuac</hi> to keepe the citie, which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17727:51"/> being brought into perill by the diſſentions of the towneſmen and inhabitants therabout, by his induſtrie abode in the faith and power of them of the Religion. To take <hi>Villeneufe</hi> there lacked more ſuccors: for the which they of <hi>Aubenac,</hi> &amp; other of theyr fellowes were to be intreated. The matter could not be ſo ſecretly kept, but that it braſt forth and came to the eares of <hi>Monſieur Leuger.</hi> He therefore increaſed his garriſon, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted thoſe to keepe watche and warde whiche in the Citie had abiured the Religion. Notwithſtanding there was not one in the Citie which knew of this purpoſe and counſaile.</p>
            <p>To bring this matter to paſſe, it was appoynted that they ſhoulde tarrie for a darke night. <hi>Monſieur Baro</hi> differing the matter as deuoyde of all warrelike pollicie, and fearing the daunger of this purpoſe, certaine monethes paſſed on, and the matter not aſſayed. In the meane tyme <hi>monſieur Leuger</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceyued and mocked by falſe Meſſengers, watched many nightes, hauing his men in a readineſſe in armes. So that he thought theſe reportes to be but vaine and falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur Pradelle</hi> at the length brought to paſſe, that in the beginning of the moneth of March, hauing gathered ſuccours togither, <hi>monſieur Baro</hi> came with his ſouldiers from <hi>Priuac</hi> to <hi>Mirebel.</hi> He came in the euening, notwithſtanding ſo, that hee had day light for certaine houres, and the watchmen and ſcoutes of <hi>mon. Leuger</hi> which lay at <hi>Mirebel</hi> in ſecret watche certified him out of hande of the comming of <hi>monſieur Baro,</hi> and telling him that he would come the ſame night vnto the citie. <hi>Monſieur Leuger,</hi> though he were oftentymes mocked, yet notwithſtanding by this report he being ſtyrred to looke aboute him, commaunded the gates of the citie to be ſhut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes: and thoſe which abiured the Religion, as ſuſpected to be put apart in diuerſe places: to double the watch: inſomuch that the towne being conueniently walled aboute, was reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſtanding watch. He commaunded bonfires to be made in euery ſtreete of the Citie, and Creſſet light to ſtand in euery window, in ſuch wiſe as the whole Citie was bright and ſhining. And he himſelfe with certaine choyſe men went
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17727:51"/> rounde about his watche. In this ſo diligent watching, they of the Religion had nothing deceyued his expectation, and if they had come at the appoynted houre, they coulde not haue preuayled: For one a clocke after midnight was the houre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, at the which time, watches are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly of leſſe force.</p>
            <p>And why they came not at the ſayde houre appoynted, this was the cauſe <hi>monſ. Baro</hi> ſhewing the danger of the attempt, thought it good not to take the ſame in hande: many valiant ſouldiers agreed herevnto, being moued with authoritie. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>monſ. Pradelle</hi> preuailed, that the attempt might be giuen: and when he had made his prayers vnto God, in the midſt of his ſouldiers, all men were ſo incouraged, that they went forward, as men perſuaded and aſſured of victorie.</p>
            <p>While the matter was thus in controuerſie, the time was delaied. <hi>Monſ. Leuger</hi> deeming that they were the accuſtomed wiles and mockes, lefte off his ſerious watch: by which time the day ſtarre appeared. Wherefore all men being deſirous of ſleepe departed. And <hi>monſieur Leuger</hi> him ſelfe went home to ſleepe, for that he had watched all the night.</p>
            <p>They of the religion come vnto the citie when all things were at reſt, through the compaſſing valleys ſhadowed wyth hilles, with the which <hi>Villeneufe</hi> was compaſſed on that ſide. And when the iron barres were pulled vp, they entred in at the forſaid hole: &amp; they that entred firſt, came vnto the chief watch, &amp; ſlue certaine ſouldiers whom they found aſleepe, &amp; ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene ſleeping and waking. And thus they ranne through the citie, crying, the towne is taken. Thus the greater part being entred in at the hole, not one ſhot being diſcharged from the walles againſt them, opened one gate. Whomſoeuer they met, they ſlue. <hi>Monſ. Leuger</hi> being waked with the noyſe of this tumult, went out of his houſe, but being conſtrayned by force to retyre againe, he kept him ſelf cloſe in the ſame, being lately well fortified. The Catholikes alſo betooke them to the tower of the greater gate, &amp; to another alſo of great heigth beſide the temple. But ſuch as were found armed in any place of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, were ſlaine by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the religion, inſomuch that the ſtreats
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17727:52"/> were filled with dead bodies. Many popiſhe prelates alſo were ſlaine, which were come thither from diuers cities therabouts, to hold a Synode. And after they had aſſailed the two towers &amp; the houſe of <hi>monſ. Leuger,</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hurt &amp; detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of both parts, the ſaid three places were yelded the third day, &amp; <hi>monſ. Leuger</hi> departed, being in great peril of the catholikes, in ſomuch that he could ſcarſly be in ſafety in his houſe, being accuſed of treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus fayth being violated, he is alſo accuſed of treaſon, by falſe ſurmiſe. So great feare came vpon al this countrey, that no doubt, they of the religion might eaſily haue taken the next citie, but that the ſouldiers being buſied about the pray, would not go elſe where. A great booty was caryed out of this little town, and much money for raunſomes was receyued, which by the negligence of the captaines, was put to priuate vſes.</p>
            <p>The Catholikes by this ſuddaine feare being awaked, held al thoſe cities which were neare vnto them, they which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Villeneufe,</hi> being gone no further. Notwithſtanding they of the religion, tooke certain little townes which bordred vpon them: and fortified <hi>Gorce,</hi> and <hi>Saluaſſe,</hi> that they might haue free paſſage from <hi>Viuijers</hi> to <hi>Niſmes.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17727:52"/> of <hi>Sommiron,</hi> they of the religion in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> beganne to looke more ſeriouſly about them, &amp; to take better order in their affayres. For in their firſt beginning of warre, the captaines and ringleaders being none of the nobilitie, but borne of baſe parentage, euerie man gouerned his ſouldiers as him lyſted, wherevpon many diſſentions aroſe among them, when as one would not obey the others counſell, according to the nature of Frenchmen, which is to like well of their owne gouenment. Therfore the inhabitantes of <hi>Niſmes</hi> (with whom they of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uijers</hi> and <hi>Seuenatz</hi> were ioyned) determined to chooſe certain of the nobilitie, whoſe commaundement the other captaynes ſhoulde not refuſe to obey. And to this order of gouernment accorded <hi>monſ. Sauroman,</hi> a noble man, and one deſeruing to be loued for his godlyneſſe and his modeſtie, who in the verie ſame gouernment afore time, had verie profitably beſtowed great diligence and paynes. Who eſcaping the cruell ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Paris, fled into Switzerlande. Him, after deliberation had they choſe, and intreated him by their letters,<note place="margin">

At the firſt he doubted what he were beſt to doe, whether he were beſt to ioyne him ſelfe with them, being in ſo great peril. Neuertheleſſe after certaine monthes, he came vnto them at the laſt, as we will declare hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ABOVT</hi> this time the Churches of <hi>Languedoc</hi> ſent into Germanie to craue helpe, that they might be able to ſuſtaine the force of warre, whiche they were aſſured would ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be moued againſt them.

            <p>After that they of <hi>Sanſerre</hi> had ſkirmiſhed certayne dayes with theyr neyghbours of <hi>Coſne,</hi> and had taken from them the pray and bootie, they were beſeeged the ninth day of Ianuary of thys preſente yeere with a copious armie, contayning fyue hundred horſemen, and fyue thouſande footemen, beſyde thoſe whych were borne and dwelling in that countrey, who came thither of their owne accord to get them renowne. The Lorde of <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> knight of the order, the kings gouernour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, was general of the Armie. He had for the batterie ſixtiene great peeces: and he cauſed a greate number of trenches and bulwarkes to be made for their defence in the ſeege.</p>
            <p>When they of the towne ſawe them ſelues beſieged,<note place="margin">The ſeege of <hi>Sanſerre.</hi>
               </note> and then too late fearing the ſcarcitie of corne, they determined to thruſt out of the Citie the ruſticall multitude. But they to whome the executing heereof was committed, ſo handled the matter, that the greater part of the common people remayned ſtill in the Citie: wherevpon enſued both to the miſerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alſo to the whole Citie an intollerable miſchiefe. So many groaſe ouerſights coulde not but bring great calamitie to them of <hi>Sanſerre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord of <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> ſending an Heralt, ſummoned them of <hi>Sanſerre</hi> to yeeld vp the towne: the which if they would doe willingly, he promiſed that he would perſwade the Kyng to deale with them in clemencie: but if they refuſed, he threatned to ſhew all ſeueritie agaynſt them. To this the <hi>Sanſerreans</hi> made no anſweare, but ſtayed the Heralt from returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and kept him in the Citie: the whych acte was agaynſte the lawe of armes, and committed by the vndiſcrete counſayle of the chiefe rulers, which notwithſtanding was diſliked of the moſt part of the towneſmen. This Acte tourned afterward to the great diſpleaſure of <hi>monſ. Iohanneau</hi> the author of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame.</p>

            <p>All thyngs neceſſary for the ſiege beyng diligently prouided by the Lorde of <hi>Chaſtre,</hi> the ſyxteene day of February of thys preſent yeere, the walles of the Citie began to be battered with ſixteene great peeces of ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, two of the which were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon a higher place of ground, and bent againſt the face of the Citie, to the great anoyance of the towneſmen.</p>
            <p>But before that time of the batterie, there was fled a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſouldier out of the Kings armie vnto the towneſmen, which bewrayed the place, which the enemie by batterie inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make ſauteable: to the which place the towneſmen came with ſpeede, fortifying the ſame with a new countermure: notwithſtanding they ſawe the enemie bend his force againſte another place of leſſe ſtrength. Yet neuertheleſſe by proofe hee found the ſame contrary to hys expectation, ſo well fortefyed, that when he had for the ſpace of three dayes done nothing but batter the ſame (for in thoſe three dayes ſpace there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely tolde three thouſande and fyue hundred ſhot of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) they had made a very ſmall breach in the wall.</p>
            <p>Alſo credible perſons whiche abode in this ſeege euen vntill the end of the ſame, report a wonderfull thing worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, namely, that amiddeſt ſo many terrible thundryng ſhot, there was not one hurt, except one onely damſell whyche was ſlayne not with the ſhot, but with the fyery flame of a peece: howbeit houſes in diuers places of the towne were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and rent, and the weapons in the hands of ſoldiers broken in peeces, alſo the helmets taken off from ſome of their heads, and the rubbiſh and ſtone worke flewe about the eares of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, withoute doyng them any hurt: Alſo at what time there was a ſermon, the houſe it ſelfe wherin the people were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togeather, was fylled with the rubbiſh of the next houſes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17727:55"/> were beaten downe, whiche things I would not report except they were approued true, that it may appeare that not without cauſe the <hi>Sanſerreans</hi> almoſt all periſhed with famine, which were deliuered out of ſo great perilles, but that God by his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular prouidence ordered the whole matter, in whoſe hande is both life and death.</p>
            <p>The breach beyng made as is aforeſayd,<note place="margin">An Engine was a foure ſquare thyng made of boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for men to goe vnder to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues from ſtones &amp; ſhot.</note> the <hi>L.

               <hi>Sanſerreans</hi> might be vnable to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>The ninetienth day of March, the Kings armie bente with might and mayne gaue an aſſalt at the breach, and in the mean time the ordinance whiche was planted on the higher grounde diſcharged luſtely at the face of the towne. The towneſmen feared the ſhaking and blowing vp of the mines, ſtandyng in doubt leaſt they ſhould breake foorth at thoſe places where they were, and fearing leaſt while they were occupyed in one place, on the other part an entrie mighte be made for the enimie. So that they were in ſore conflict with dyuers extremities.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtandyng they had ſuche ſucceſſe in the ende, that the enimie was not only repulſed, but ſlayne alſo with a greate ſlaughter, in ſomuch that he was diſcouraged any more to giue any aſſalt vnto the towne, beeyng taught by the example of the former warres.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the <hi>L.</hi> of <hi>Chaſtre</hi> perceyuing that it was but loſt labour, beſyde the great ſpoyle alſo of his men, to giue any more aſſalts to the towne, and beeing warned by the error of <hi>monſ. Martinenge,</hi> who aforetime was generall in the other ſeege, but in vayne, deuiſed another way of beſeeging, thinking it good to leaue off the aſſalting of the ſame, and rather wyth ſtrong bulwarkes to incloſe it, that neyther they whiche were within the Citie might come foorth, nor yet thoſe whych were without myght haue acceſſe to them whych were within: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayne the towneſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beyng brought to extreame famine, to giue vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne, the which in deede came to paſſe.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:17727:56"/>
            <p>Therefore the daye following whiche was the twenty of March, he diſplaced hys Artillerie, and ouerthrewe and brente the fortifications which he had erected about the Citie, and the whole armie almoſt truſſed vp bagge and baggage.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17727:58"/> in the dytch, ſeruing to make eruptions, and to repulſe the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie from the walles. He, taking with him tenne of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, came vnto that part of the kings camp, which was neare vnto the Lazerhouſe, where he founde twelue noble men ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at ſupper, whome he ſlue, notwithſtanding that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him very large raunſomes to redeeme their lyfe, and when he had doone, returned in ſafetie vnto the citie agayne. This was doone in the night of the ſame day.</p>
            <p>The ſeuententh day was ſpent wholy in giuing an aſſault. The day folowing, when the kings campe went about by trenches and baſkets to approch more neare vnto the walles, there enſued a ſore battell, the towneſmen comming out of the towne to withſtand the enimie.</p>
            <p>The next day after, the towneſmen came again to the ſame fortification, and for all that the enimie coulde doe, they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threwe their baſkets &amp; burdels, and tumbled great woolpackes full of wooll into the ditch, and ſlaying at the ſame place three ſcore of them, chaſed the reſt to the caſtell <hi>Palereau.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Palereau.</note> The ſame day at nyght certaine ſhot of the kings campe, came into the trench of the bulwark <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> &amp; taking ſome of the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vnawares ſlue them.</p>
            <p>The twentie day, the batterie was begon againe with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie three great peeces, which were planted in ſeuerall places: notwithſtanding the walles of the city were not much impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the roofes of houſes in diuers places were pulled downe, whereat many a vayne ſhot was diſcharged. There were told the ſame day a thouſand and fiue hundred ſtroakes.</p>
            <p>The two and twentie day, a newe aſſault was intended to be giuen, about three of the clocke in the afternoone: but bicauſe the towne beganne to diſcharge againſt them, whereby many of the Kings campe were ſlayne, they ſtayed their former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and encountred the towne with mayne ſhot, vntill ſixe of the clocke in the euening.</p>
            <p>It was told the towneſmen, that the enimie had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame day to winne the tower, which ſtoode betweene the gate <hi>Rambalde,</hi> and the Bulwarke <hi>l' Euangile:</hi> and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17727:59"/> the treaſons of the citie were feared. Therefore the townſmen prepared them ſelues for defence, appoynting in diuers neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie places watch and warde.</p>
            <p>All this while the townſmen tooke great paines in making bulwarks in the citie of earth, compact with turffes and ſtakes to bynde the ſame.</p>
            <p>One of the kings mynes was ouerwhelmed, to the greate ſpoyle of the pioners. That nyght there was in the citie a great earthquake,<note place="margin">An earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> the which ſome ſay, was the cauſe of the ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſayde myne, but in my iudgement it is vnlikely. From the laſt day of Februarie, vnto the ſixe and twentie of this moneth, there were tolde twelue thouſand and ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtroakes of the kings gunnes.</p>
            <p>The ſame daye by the commandemente of the Maior, one <hi>Chale,</hi> whoſe name was famous in Rochell, and whome we reckoned before among the captaynes of the warre, went out of the citie, for that the <hi>Rochellians</hi> had him in ſuſpition, and ſo came vnto the kings campe.</p>
            <p>The day folowing, the towneſmen made an eruption vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a troupe of horſmen, which they diſcouered to ſtande at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> and after a ſkyrmiſhe, by which both partes ſuſtayned loſſe, they retyred.</p>
            <p>The eyght and twentie day of Marche, the whole armie of the king was ſet in battell araye, euen as if they woulde haue giuen an aſſault to the gate of <hi>Cogne,</hi> and to the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile.</hi> Notwithſtanding, after they had for the ſpace of one houre diſcharged ſhot one againſt the other, with the loſſe and hurt of both partes, they ſounded the retraycte. About ſixe of the clocke in the euening the kings campe returned agayne, and placing a troupe at <hi>Sannicolas</hi> gate, the reſt ſtoode in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell aray at <hi>Cogne</hi> gate.</p>
            <p>Their purpoſe was to take the <hi>Cazemates,</hi> whiche were in the dytche. And for this cauſe fortie of the kings ſouldiers went downe into the dytche, notwythſtanding, they were ſo repulſed by the townſmen, that many of the kings campe fell into the ditch. In the meane time the great gunnes thundered
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17727:59"/> both from the towne, and alſo out of the kings campe: from which fortie ſhot were diſcharged.</p>
            <p>The day following was ſpent onely in giuing an aſſault. But the next day after that there was a ſore battaile fought betweene the <hi>Rochellians</hi> and the kings campe. The cauſe of the battaile was this. Three ſouldiers went out of the towne, and ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt watch of the kings camp. Then the whole campe armed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. By &amp; by there came out of the towne others to reſcue the firſt: wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enimie came on by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, vpon whom the Caliuer ſhot came as thicke as haile: and ſuch a tempeſt of great ſhot droue agaynſt the threeſquare bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, whiche was ſet in aray wedgewiſe to pearce into theyr enimies, that of the forefront of the ſame, fiue with targettes were ſlaine, and after them many other ſouldiers. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at <hi>Tadon</hi> certaine horſmen, at the firſt but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to allure the towneſmen to battaile: but when they ſawe that none would come forth to encounter with them, a greater number diſcouered themſelues: ouer whom <hi>Countie Luden</hi> was generall. Theſe horſemen being within the leuel of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicolas</hi> tower were a fayre marke: ſo that their horſes and they themſelues were ouerthrowne and ſlaine in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the violent ſhot of the ſame.</p>
            <p>About the euening the kings ſide to requite the late ſuſtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loſſe, ſlue with theyr great Gunnes certaine Souldiers and Captaynes.</p>
            <p>The next day the kings ſcoutewatche was hanged by the decree of the <hi>Rochellians:</hi> who was ſayde to bewray and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the ſecretes of the towneſmen. The ſame day two ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fled from the kings campe to Rochel. The kings campe in the Euening chaunged theyr accuſtomed maner of watch: and ſhot off twelue great peeces agaynſt the towneſmen.</p>
            <p>The day following whiche was the firſt day of April,<note place="margin">April.</note> the towneſmen in the deade time of the night ſhot off a peece of ordinance, which in the day time they had leuelled and bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the tents whiche were pytched beſide <hi>Palercau,</hi> by the which many ſleeping vpon their couches were ſlaine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17727:60"/> the kings campe diſcharged incontinent at them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine a great peale, by whiche two of the Captaynes belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the towne were ſlaine. The ſame day Captain <hi>Dange</hi> fled from the kings campe to Rochel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IN</hi> the kings campe, by reaſon of the great multitude of ſouldiers in the ſame, and the penurie of the country therabout, vittayles were ſo deare, that the ſouldiers priuily ſtale away: and the horſmen and noble men, which vpon their own charge mainteyned warre, for that prouender was ſcarce and harde to be gotten, went home to their houſes. Vpon this contempt and negligence of warlyke order and prouiſion, inſued alſo in the campe great ſickneſſe, inſomuch that within few dayes, the ſickneſſe deſtroyed more than the ſworde had done. The forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of corne were conſtrayned to cary prouiſion from Paris, and from the places theraboutes: but, notwithſtanding that the king gaue ſtrayt commaundement in this behalfe, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited little. The king alſo in this backſliding of the noble men, gaue ſtrayte charge to reſtrayne the ſame: but in vaine. Thus whiles delayes of this ſiege were made, the kings campe was brought into great extremitie: and all men thought that the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſhould haue bene conſtrayned to raiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue the ſiege,<note place="margin">The extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the kings campe.</note> without his purpoſe. Whervpon the king wrote vnto his brother, willing him to make ſpeede in aſſaulting the towne: and to winne the ſame out of hande, or elſe to rayſe the ſiege. For by this tyme the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> had ſpent fiue Monethes. Therefore he appoynted the ſixth day of Aprill to giue an aſſault, on the which day the whole armie aſſayled the towne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> ſeuenth day, about fiue of the clocke in the morning, the kings campe beganne a freſhe to batter with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than they had done, before the gate <hi>Cogne,</hi> and the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark <hi>l'Euangile.</hi> Thus after long batterie, that part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wall was beaten downe to the ground,<note place="margin">The <hi>Caze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> taken and forſaken againe.</note> and the greateſt part of the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile</hi> battered downe. Therefore the kings ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie prepared themſelues to enter the breache. Who tooke out of euerie bande onely twentie: and fyrſt of all, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17727:60"/> tooke two of the <hi>Cazemates</hi> from the towneſmen: which notwithſtanding they enioyed but few houres. For the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men luſtily diſcharged theyr greate Gunnes agaynſt them, whereby they ſlewe many of the kings ſouldiers: and when they of the towne had made a newe ſupply of men, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned their enimies to forſake their <hi>Cazemates:</hi> an act veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the firſt aſſault verie manly and valiant.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, about the ſame houre the kings armie gaue an aſſault on the other part at the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> and ſetting vnto the ſame a bridge made with proppes and ſhores, they tooke ſome part of the ſame: then to this part they came running by heapes, hauing two hundred Corſlettes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhields and targets before them. At the ſame moment alſo the great Gunnes went off as thicke as poſſible they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the towne, and the townſmen ſuſtayned great loſſe and dammage. For the accounte being made, it is ſayde that there were heard the ſame day two thouſand &amp; fiue hundred blowes of great Gunnes. The towneſmen valiantly put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for their defence agaynſt theyr aſſayling enimies. The women courageouſly threw alſo vpon them fierie hoopes, pitch barrels burning, and balles of fire, and ſuch kinde of fireworke, by which they did greatly anoy them.</p>
            <p>Thus the enimies preuayling nothing at all were repulſed. Of the towneſmen there were threeſcore ſlaine, and certaine chiefe Captaynes alſo, and many wounded. And of the kings ſide (as hath appeared by their own writings and report) there were aboue three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred ſlaine, and many wounded. Among the noble men were wounded the Duke of <hi>Niuern,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of <hi>Neme</hi> one of the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> brethren, &amp; <hi>M. d'Gaſt,</hi> of <hi>Daulphine,</hi> which was in great fauor with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day following about eight of the clocke, the kings ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie gaue another aſſault to the towne: notwithſtanding the towneſmen repulſed them with like courage as they had done before, &amp; with the ſame ſucceſſe. Alſo they preferring themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to giue the like aſſault about fiue of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, the towneſmen beeing in like maner readie to receyue
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17727:61"/> them, left off their enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A ſigne in the ayre.</note>The ſame night there was manifeſtly ſeene in the ayre a great fire, whiche had the forme and ſimilitude of a Dragon, which fell into the ſea in the ſight of many.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Smoke made in the Citie.</note>The towneſmen to the end they might haue libertie to mend and repayre theyr walles, made a ſmoke ſo thicke and darke, that the whole campe was incloſed as it were with a cloude. In the meane tyme there were throwne oute of the Citie in plentifull wiſe ſuche fire workes as wee named before, to the greate horror and feare of the beſiegers, as they themſelues report.</p>
            <p>The next day, the kings armie ſtoode in battaile aray, euen as if they would haue giuen an aſſault: notwithſtanding the <hi>Rochellians</hi> beeing readie to receyue them, they ſtayed from theyr purpoſe. In the meane tyme there were diſcharged from the kings fortifications foureſcore ſhot of great Gunnes. In the euening the enimies made a great ſhoute and crie in the campe of purpoſe, as if they had bene oppreſſed with ſome eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie (which we call a falſe Alarme) thereby to entice forth the towneſmen.</p>
            <p>The tenth day, about foure of the clocke in the morning, the enimie ſtoode arayed in diuerſe pearcing battayles. Which was a ſigne of an intended aſſault. Whervpon all the towneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men prepared for their defence, women alſo were appoynted to their charge, yea children were not ydle: Aboute ſixe of the clocke, the kings power with great violence aſſayled the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke <hi>l'Euangile.</hi> And on the other part manie of the enimies were diſcouered to ſcale the gate <hi>Moline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Tadon</hi> Countie <hi>Luden</hi> being with his bande, was alſo come to the tower of <hi>Moline:</hi> notwithſtanding he was ſoone repulſed thence by the whotte and fearce ſhotte of the greate Gunnes diſcharged by the towne. Ladders were ſet to the walles,<note place="margin">The ſcaling ladders are ouerthrowne.</note> and the towneſmen in the meane tyme making no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they climbe them: but when manye of them were come to the top of the Ladders, and the ſayde Ladders fully repleniſhed, by and by thoſe townſmen which before lay hid,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17727:61"/> diſcouered themſelues, being prepared with ſpeares and long poales, and ouerthrew their ladders with ſo violent an aſſault, that euen with one force, as it were, they being repulſed, the troupes whiche abode at the lower part of the walles were made afearde with the great noyſe and crie of thoſe that fell: and being put to flight with the great plentie of ſhotte, ranne away like madde men, and caſt themſelues headlong into the Mariſhes for feare.</p>
            <p>Then incontinently the women went forth with ſpits and ſhouels, &amp; ſuch like apt weapons belonging to womens war,<note place="margin">The victorie gotten by women.</note> with the whiche they layde at thoſe whom they founde ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and eaſily ſlue them, and caryed away the ſpoyle, no man reſiſting him. On the other part, the towneſmen no leſſe valiantly behaued themſelues in fight at the Bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> inſomuch that the ſhowering Gunſhot neuer miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the heades of the Catholikes, who were alſo much annoyed with fireworkes caſt out of the towne vpon them. Therefore the kings ſide was conſtrayned to retyre, aboue three hundred ſouldiers of his being loſt at that charge.</p>
            <p>The next day after the Catholikes fortefyed with a rampire that part of the Bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> which they had taken: and when they had ſet themſelues in battaile aray making a ſhew as if they would haue giuen a newe charge, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any enterpriſe, perceyuing that the towneſmen prepared themſelues for their defence.</p>
            <p>They made alſo a mine for that bulwark: and made a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ouer againſt the ſame to anoy the towneſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the towneſmen prouided in making a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>termine with a gate to the ſame conueniently, belonging for ſodaine eruptions.</p>
            <p>About ſixe of the clocke in the euening the <hi>Rochellians</hi> cried Alarme vpon this occaſion: A certaine woman, whiche was gone downe into a certain Wineſeller to drawe wine, hearde the voyce of a man ſpeaking: By which ſhe thought that the enimies had made theyr mynes ſo farre: and therefore cryed oute. The people at thys crie armed themſelues. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enquirie made of the matter, it was founde oute that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17727:62"/> certayne of the towneſmen, by the commaundement of the Maior, were ſearchyng for the conducte pypes which ſerued the towne with water.</p>
            <p>The ſame day great ſtoare of corne, &amp; great plentie of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition for warre was brought into the kings campe.</p>
            <p>The day followyng, another parte of the bulwarke <hi>l'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangile</hi> whiche remayned of the former breache, was beaten downe by a violent batterie: by the fall whereof many bothe of the Towneſmen and alſo of the Catholiques, were ſlayne, and with them a certayne Captayne whiche had conducted a bande of ſouldiours to that parte to gyue an aſſault.</p>
            <p>The next day there was nothyng done woorthy to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, ſauyng that the towneſmen caſtyng fire into the ditche brente certayne ſouldiours and pioners. The ſame day the towneſmen brake foorth at the Caſemates belongyng to the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> and ſlew many of the kyngs ſouldiers, and brought theyr armour into the Citie. On the other parte the great gunnes went off from the towne agaynſt the kings fortes, whereby many of the Catholiques were ſlayne.</p>
            <p>The nientene day ſhyppes were diſcryed in the ſea appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted and prepared for warre:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mongomeries</hi> nauie within ſight of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</hi>
               </note> the whiche roade at anker within a myle of <hi>Rochel</hi> hauen called <hi>Chef-de bois.</hi> By and by the Kyngs nauie was prepared: and out of the kyngs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie bandes of ſoldiers were appoynted to defende the coaſte: and others to furniſhe the ſhyppes: and ſtrayte way a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peale of thunderyng ſhotte was rung betweene them.</p>
            <p>This nyghte at the commaundement of the <hi>Rochellians,</hi> a Captayne went foorth with one ſhippe, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng that the enemie reſiſted, he came in ſafety vnto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of <hi>Mongomerie,</hi> of whome they receyued a ſigne that ayde was come to them of <hi>Rochel.</hi> Notwithſtandyng thoſe ſhyppes were diuided in the mornyng. So the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques returned into the campe. Aboute the euenyng there came a meſſenger, whiche tolde that thoſe ſhyppes were not farre off.</p>
            <p>Whereas the townſmen wente about with great diligence
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17727:62"/> to repayre the breache and ruyne of the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> the Catholiques ſought to beate it downe with ſhot. Twoo of the kings armie fled to the gate <hi>d'Molines</hi> to the townſmen notwithſtandyng the ſhowers of ſhot which were diſcharged after them.</p>
            <p>The towneſmen made a countermine, agaynſt that myne whiche the catholiques had made for the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile.</hi> To this they ſet fire, but bycauſe there was not ſufficient ſtore of gunpowder in the ſame, theyr labour was loſt.</p>
            <p>The nexte day a newe charge was gyuen. The ſame day there came vnto <hi>Cogne, Monſieur Oars,</hi> and <hi>Rolli,</hi> to ſpeake with the Maior in the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> his name. The cauſe of this parley was, that wayes myghte be taken for peace. To the kyngs Ambaſſadours came the Maior, <hi>Nortius</hi> the Paſtor of the Churche, and <hi>Monſieur Eſſarz,</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and when they had ſpente certayne howers in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication togyther, they returned into the Citie. About eight of the clocke the Catholiques blewe vp the mine whiche they had made at the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile.</hi> The earth fallyng o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwartly ſlewe many of the Catholiques, and fiftene of the townſmen. At this tumulte all the whole citie was armed: but not one of the Catholiques appeared.</p>
            <p>The day followyng, a freſhe aſſaulte was giuen, that the pioners whiche made a mine, by the noyſe of the gunnes might not be perceyued of the townſmen.</p>
            <p>The nexte daye the ſame Ambaſſadours came agayne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the treatie of peace: when as notwithſtandyng theyr fellowes perſiſted no leſſe vehement than they did before in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the aſſaulte.</p>
            <p>In the dead time of the nighte of the ſame day, a piercyng battayle of the Catholiques, beyng conducted by ſkilfull and valiant captaines wanne the ditche: notwithſtandyng they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned to retire with great loſſe of their men. Then began the great gunnes to thunder.</p>
            <p>The twentieth day, there was a ſore charge gyuen agaynſt the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile</hi> by the Catholiques: And euen in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17727:63"/> the middeſt of the fight, fyre was put into the myne, the which the Towneſmen foreſeeing, auoyded the daunger thereof, and beguyled the enemie. They fought for the ſpace of fiue houres without ſtaye or retraite. Fifteene of the Towneſmen onely were ſlayne, and thirtie hurte: but verye many Catholiques were loſte, who ſuſteyned great dammage by the towneſmen at the drawe bridge, out of the <hi>Caſemates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt day the townſmen made an inroade to the forts of the Catholiques, and ſlew many of them: and then with loſſe of ſome of their men, returned into the citie agayne. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellians</hi> ſende their requeſtes concerning the peace to the duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Maye.</note>The firſte daye of May, the towneſmen ſet vp vppon the walles green boughes, in token of ioy, and ſang Pſalmes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, playing with cornets and trumpets, &amp; ioyning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the noyſe of Gunnes.

            <p>The next day <hi>Monſieur Oars</hi> brought the kings anſwere from the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> to the <hi>Rochellians</hi> concerning theyr demaunds. In the nighte followyng, the townſmen brake out of their countermine into the Catholikes myne, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from thence the Catholiques, and placyng watche and warde there, they ouerthrew the ſame.</p>
            <p>The two nexte dayes were ſpente with two fortunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, &amp; with taking conſultation concerning the kings anſwere: Euery towneſman without exception, had leaue to come to this conſultation: and the daye and place of meeting was appoynted.</p>
            <p>The fourth day of this moneth, the Nauie ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was more playnely to be ſeene, at the ſyght whereof, the Catholiques withoute delaye armed themſelues. For it was Countie <hi>Mongomerie</hi> with fiftie ſayle greate and ſmall. And thus it fared with <hi>Mongomerie. Mongomerie</hi> comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Englande, laboured by all meanes to obtayne ayde at the handes of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Queenes maieſtie of England. The whiche hir Maieſtie denyed, bycauſe of the league whiche ſhe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17727:63"/> had made with the king. Therfore <hi>Mongomerie</hi> tooke an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, getting into his handes partly by loane, and partly by gift, of Engliſh, Frenchemen, and the lowe countreymen of <hi>Flaunders</hi> fortie thouſande frankes: and got leaue of the Queenes maieſtie to furniſhe a nauie ſo well as he coulde. Thus after long trauayle he furniſhed fiftie ſhippes. But oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion fell out, whiche delayed for a tyme that expedition and preparation. The Earle of Worceſter a noble man of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande went into Fraunce in the Queenes name, to baptize the newe borne daughter of the French king, and to be one of the ſureties or witneſſes for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd child in hir highnes name. In this paſſage certayn Frenchmen and Flemings ſet vppon him, taking from him one of his ſhippes, and killing certaine of his men. Hir highneſſe taking diſpleaſure hereat, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the matter to be enquired after: for the which inquiſition ſhe ſent the Lorde Admirall, who ſetting vpon all the ſhippes of the Frenchmen and Flemings, toke &amp; caried away whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer came to his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. So that twentie of <hi>Mongomeries</hi> ſhips were loſte. So he came to the coaſt of Rochell with twentie ſhips of his nauie diminiſhed. When he ſawe the kings nauie prepared, and newe ſhips alſo to be furniſhed with other ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, he durſt not procede in this enterpriſe: wherfore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſayling his enimies, he directed his courſe an other way, and vnloked for at <hi>Bell'Iſle,</hi> and there landed, and took both the Iſle and the caſtel. The <hi>Rochellians</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Mongo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merie</hi> was departed, and therfore being without hope of ayde, fortifyed the hauen all that they coulde wyth newe garriſons. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding before <hi>Mongomeries</hi> departure, they ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out one vnto him in a ſkyffe, wylling him not to put himſelfe in peryll for theyr ſakes: for they truſted yet in the goodneſſe of GOD, and were of that mynd, that they would rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any maner of extremitie, than to yelde themſelues into the handes of ſuche men as were full of all treaſon, falſhood, and periurie. After the which meſſage <hi>Mongomerie</hi> ſent a ſhip vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie with goonpouder and victuall, which came ſafely into Rochell, notwithſtanding the kings force. And after this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17727:64"/> (as we ſayd) <hi>Mongomerie</hi> tooke a new viage.</p>
            <p>After he had taried in the foreſayde Ilande certayne dayes, and knew not wel which way to take, his ſouldiers alſo being obſtinate and diſobedient, returned into <hi>England,</hi> hauyng loſt his trauayle, with a fewe ſhippes, the reſt beyng left vppon the ſea to robbe and ſpoyle, one of the whiche (whereof <hi>Monſieur Hippinnill</hi> was captayne) went to the enimie.</p>
            <p>To fortifie the ſiege of <hi>Rochel</hi> there came into the kyngs campe the fifth day of May foure thouſand <hi>Switzers.</hi> Therfore certaine dayes following were ſpent in ſkyrmiſhes, loſſe of men beyng ſuſtayned on both partes. And amongſt the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that were ſlaine,<note place="margin">Monſ. Coſsine <hi>ſlayne.</hi>

               <hi>Monſieur Coſsine</hi> captaine of the kings garde, beyng one of thoſe whiche ſlew the Admiral, was one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CERTAINE</hi> Catholiques got vp vnlooked for vpon the bulwarke <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> and tooke the watch of the ſame, the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being a ſleepe,<note place="margin">The forte <hi>l'Euangile</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wonne.</note> ſome of the which they ſlew. Whervpon if the townſmen had not ſuccored them in time, and reſiſted the other, or if a greater number of the Catholiques had bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the citie had bene in great daunger.</p>
            <p>The next daye the townſmen gaue a woorthy charge vpon the Catholiques of whom they ſlew many. There brake out of the citie fiue hundred at <hi>Cogne</hi> gate, and charged the enemie being intrenched and ſuſpecting no ſuch thing, by reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſlewe many of them, and put the reſt to flight, &amp; choked three of their great gunnes by driuyng into them croſſe barres of iron. As they were thus occupied, there came ſuccours from the kings campe: and then began a ſore ſkirmiſh. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the townſmen brought with them into the citie eight of the catholikes Enſignes, &amp; great ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of armour &amp; apparel:</p>
            <p>There were ſlayne in this ſkyrmiſh two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred catholikes, or thereabouts, &amp; twentie only of the townſmen were wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting. The townſmen with great triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe ſet vp on their walles thoſe Enſignes which they had taken from their enemies.</p>
            <p>The ſixe and twentie day of this moneth the Catholiques began a newe batterie, after the whiche they giue a freſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte to the towne, beyng the moſt notable of all the reſte that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17727:64"/> happened in this ſiege. The commyng of the <hi>Switzers</hi> was the cauſe of this aſſaulte: who craued leaue of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> that they might gyue an aſſaulte to the citie, thereby to declare theyr loue towarde the king.</p>
            <p>Therfore al theyr bandes ſet themſelues in battaile aray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the well &amp; <hi>le Rouze,</hi> about ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the clocke. The which they of <hi>Cogne</hi> perceyuing, diſcharged fiue great peeces, the ſhot wherof fel among the thickeſt of them, to theyr great damage. Therefore they ſhyfted their ſtandyng. Alſo other bandes of the Catholiques were ſet in battayle aray in diuers places, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if they would giue an aſſault. In the meane tyme the great gunnes went off luſtely on eyther part. But the greateſt hope of the Catholiques reſted in their mines, which were made in three ſeueral places. The firſt myne hauing fire giuen vnto it, did ſmall hurte, makyng a breach no bigger than for twoo men to enter at: whiche breache the townſmen ſtopte with greate diligence. Straite after the ſecond was blowen vp with great force: and the thyrde made a greate noyſe ouerthrowyng a great parte of the wall: notwithſtanding ſo that the rubbell &amp; matter of the wall fell into the towne: by the conuenient fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherof the paſſage into the Citie was ſtopte agaynſt the Catholiques. The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> was preſent himſelf, that by his preſence he might encourage the ſouldiers. And the firſte onſet was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by <hi>Monſ. d'Gaſte:</hi> but the townſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo receyued him, that he was conſtrayned to retire with great loſſe of hys men. After him followed <hi>Monſ. d'Goaz,</hi> who with his bande entring the breach with a violent charge, at the firſt enforced the <hi>Rochellians</hi> to gyue backe: but yet they perſiſted ſo valiantly in fight, that they ſlew <hi>Monſ. Goaz,</hi> and diuers other chiefe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptaines and ſouldiers, and cauſed the reſt to retyre. Then came the thyrde bande, who gaue the thirde aſſault with like ſucceſſe as the other had done. During theſe aſſaultes, the women tooke ſuche great paynes in caſtyng downe fire woorkes in ſuch abundant manner, that they deſerue a great parte of the prayſe of that victorie. And by the miſte of a certaine ſmoke which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townſmen made of purpoſe, they fought with ſmal loſſe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17727:65"/> the number being fortie onely. But of the Catholikes, there were aboue foure hundred ſlaine, moſt of the which were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, and ſouldiers of great ſkill, which fought in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. At <hi>Tadon</hi> alſo the towneſmen had as happie ſucceſſe in their fight agaynſt the Catholikes at the time, as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, going nowe aboute to winne the Citie by ſcaling the walles at that part. The walles of the towne were ſhyning bryght with the flame of the burning fyrebrandes which lay in the ditches.</p>
            <p>The next day the towneſmen to ſcorne the enimie, armed their ſcullyons and ſlaues, and brought them forth at <hi>Cogne</hi> gate, with naked ſwordes in triumphant wiſe in their hands. The Catholikes armed themſelues: and they ſtreight way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre into the Citie: the towneſmen in the meane time calling the Switzers to battaile in diriſion.</p>
            <p>The Catholikes put into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ditches certain gunnes, to ſhake downe the Caſemates: but in vaine. By the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Maior threeſcore men, and women, and children of the raſcal ſort of people, were brought out of the Citie. The <hi>Rochellians</hi> were ſolicited to peace,<note place="margin">Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning peace.</note> a Harault being ſent vnto them with letters of certaine of their familiar friendes which were in the kings campe. In fine, the kings ſingular good wil to be at peace with them, was declared: they were alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted not to depriue them and theyrs of ſo good an occaſion of peace. The towneſmen went forth to diſplace the fortes which were made ouer agaynſt the gate of <hi>Sannicolas,</hi> wherevpon enſued a great tempeſt of ſhot as thicke as hayle, to the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of both partes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iune.</note>The day following, whiche was the firſt of Iune, foure towneſmen making thoſe afearde which lay in the next tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and thought no doubt that there had bene a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and putting them to flight, no man making reſiſtance, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew their baſkets and bulwarkes.</p>
            <p>There entered into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie two Souldiers with letters from <hi>Mongomerie:</hi> in the which he gaue them to vnderſtande that he was conſtrayned to returne into Englande, to bring a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17727:65"/> greater power, with the which he woulde ſhortly come vnto them:<note place="margin">Letters of <hi>Mongomerie</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellians.</hi>
               </note> Incouraging them to goe forwarde in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, in the whiche they had by the goodneſſe of God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vntill that day.</p>
            <p>The Catholikes fortifyed the trench which was at the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke <hi>l'Euangile,</hi> and that part allo whiche was ſomewhat nearer to <hi>Sannicolas.</hi> A certaine Souldier crauing leaue of the Maior to go forth of the Citie, vnder pretence to aſſayle the enimie, fled into the kings campe. The Caſemates were day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſaulted, but in vaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BVT</hi> the towneſmen were not onely vrged with external enimies, but alſo with domeſtical and inwarde extremities. Many were wearie of the war: and many feared the famine, by whiche the towneſmen feared greate deſtruction. Diuerſe men diuerſlye communed togither, miſlyking all that they coulde of thoſe extremities: there were manye of the rycher ſorte whiche were greeued for the waſting and loſſe of theyr goodes: inſomuche that by all maner of meanes they deſyred peace. Therefore they withſtoode the whole aſſembly. And certaine alſo had determined to take the gate, and to goe oute of the ſame. For this cauſe certaine of the wellbyer ſorte by the decree of the Senate, were put in priſon. As yet the penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of corne did not grieue the towneſmen, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſtore was greatly diminiſhed, which they feared dayly more and more. But the <hi>Rochellians</hi> had ſtore of Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhe and wine. And it is wonderful which certaine honeſt and credible perſons do report, which were at that ſiege, how that a certaine kinde of fiſhe came into the hauen in ſuch plentifull maner, contrary to their woonted cuſtome,<note place="margin">A new kinde of fiſhe in the time of the ſiege came to Rochel.</note> that the poorer ſorte vſed to eate them in ſteade of breade, and that the ſame plentie went away almoſt the ſame day, when the kings army depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the concluſion of peace. On the contrary part, no leſſe extremities vrged the king, as the ſcarcitie of money, and the impaciencie of the nobles, whiche were wearie of the warre, coulde by no meanes be reſtrayned. And the king was vnable to hemme in or incloſe the towne of Rochel, the ſame being ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17727:66"/> large and populous, and the ſea coaſt being ſo neare vnto the ſame. Therefore both partes were fully determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace. And to further this matter the, Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> had ioyful and acceptable newes concerning the kingdome of <hi>Polonia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> choſen king of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>MONLVCE</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> had ſolicited the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the noble men of <hi>Polonia</hi> with great diligence, and with golden ſermons: the whiche alſo he cauſed to be put in print, thereby ſeeking to win vnto his maiſter a kingdome.</p>
            <p>A great ſcruple and doubt was obiected about the murders of Paris, the cauſes whereof by open rumors were layde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> Notwithſtanding <hi>Monluce</hi> ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that in the name of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> hee perſwaded the ſtates of <hi>Polonia:</hi> Concerning the ſucceſſe of the which election we will ſpeake in another place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Occaſion of peace.</note>This therefore was a ſpecial occaſion to rayſe the ſiege. All this while the Catholikes came oftentymes to <hi>Cogne</hi> gate to intreate for a peace.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe communications of peace, the Citie was very neare intercepted, through the great ſecuritie of the townſmen. For a hundred Catholikes with Ladders clymed vp to the toppe of the walles, and tooke a viewe of theyr Fortes: the which being diſcouered, the towneſmen cryed Alarme, and with ſpeedie diſpatch they were repulſed and put to flight: but fiftene of them were ſlaine by falling from the walles into the Citie.</p>
            <p>For ioy of the newes of <hi>Polonia,</hi> there were triumphant ſhouts, and thundring peale of great gunnes, both in the kings campe, and alſo in the nauie. There fell downe twentie cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites of the walles at this peale. To the ruyne and breache whereof the towneſmen ranne out of hande, ſuſpecting that the enimie was come, and ſtoode armed in a readineſſe for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine houres.</p>
            <p>After long contentions it was at the laſt agreed betweene
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17727:66"/> the kings armie and the <hi>Rochellians,</hi> that the ſayd <hi>Rochellians</hi> ſhould go and ſubmit themſelues to the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and deſire peace of him. Wherevpon the <hi>Rochellians</hi> receyued in the name of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> aſſurance of truce, and were cleared of the name of Rebels, with the which afore time they were called: the <hi>Rochellians</hi> complayning of the ſame vnto the meſſengers that were ſent vnto them.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> went downe into a mine. A ſouldier knewe him, who by and by diſcharged at him his peece:<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> is in peril of his lyfe.</note> with the ſhot whereof he ſlue a noble man which ſtoode hard by him: and ſome of the haile ſhot ran through the ruffe of the ſhirtband of the duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and yet he had no harme: but not without great peril of his life.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rochellians</hi> had intelligence giuen them that treaſon was a working agaynſt them vnder the colour of a parley, whereby they were admoniſhed to looke diligently about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to be in a readineſſe. Notwithſtanding the Ambaſſadors of peace come at the day appoynted, and by common conſent truce is taken: the which notwithſtanding was not obſerued, the townſmen complayning that the kings ſouldiers had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a view of their ditch to their dammage. So that the truce being broken, a freſhe battaile began betwene them,<note place="margin">Truce bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> wherein ſeuen of the kings ſide were ſlaine, and of the towneſmen, one yong man. About the Euening, by the Maiors commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, al the Citizens and other towneſmen which were there preſent, were called togither to heare the principal poynts and conditions of the kings peace.</p>
            <p>There came into the kings campe Ambaſſadors from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> for the ioy of whoſe comming, many peales of greate gunnes were ſhot off. <hi>monſ. l'Noe</hi> returned to the parley with the towneſmen in the name of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the kings ordinance ſhooting off in the meane time.

            <p>The Ambaſſadors concerning the peace making, returned agayne. But the purpoſe of the Catholikes was in time of
<pb facs="tcp:17727:67"/> the parley to blowe vp a myne. This the towneſmen vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode: wherevpon all men at the Maiors commaundement were readie in armour. Therefore they determined to deferre the matter vntill the parley were ended. They had great hope to preuayle in the breaking vp of the myne. About the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire was ſet to the myne, the whiche beeing blowen vp, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrewe the wall, notwithſtanding to ſuch aduauntage for the towneſmen, that the enimie could not ſo eaſily enter as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might haue done: alſo one of the kings great Gunnes fell into the ditche.

            <p>They of <hi>Niſme,</hi> and of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and others whiche had taken their part, were eaſily admitted to the ſame benefit.

Therfore he thought it good to take peace with the <hi>Rochellians,</hi> to ſhune the reproche of the foyle, as though by conſtraynt he had rayſed his ſiege. Alſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Polonia</hi> vrged him, before whom he thought it not conuenient for his dignitie to ſuſtain ſo great
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17727:67"/> diſhonour: and therefore he prouided for the ſame by a ſpeciall remedy: leaſt with ſhame, his armie ſhould be conſtrayned to depart after ſo long a ſiege: ſpecially ſuch honorable &amp; famous perſonages of a ſtrange countrey being preſent. The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſayd, that both at their inſtance, and alſo at the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Rochellians,</hi> he forgaue muche. The <hi>Rochellians</hi> both earneſtly deſired to be deliuered from the extreame trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the long ſiege, and alſo were very carefull for that which ſhould folowe afterwarde.

In the meane while, truce was taken for ſixe dayes. The towneſmen come into the kings campe, bring wine vnto his ſouldiers, and receiue meate and other food of them again: they ſaluted alſo &amp; talked friendly one with another.

               <hi>THIS</hi> was the end and ſucceſſe of the warre of <hi>Rochell,</hi> at what time the kings power being complete, and they of the Religion of ſmall force, and as it were vtterly vanquiſhed, there ſeemed to be a perfect victorie and conqueſt offered: the which if it had come to paſſe (as by Gods wonderfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it fell out otherwiſe) according to the kings will, there woulde haue bin no leſſe outrageous murders committed in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17727:72"/> all parts of the Realme, to deſtroy thoſe that remayned of the Religion, than afore time: in ſomuch that the bloud of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame would haue flowed euen into forreyne nations alſo. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all hope and reaſon it fell out otherwiſe, the miniſters and inſtruments of the murders them ſelues, comming to thys warre to receyue the iuſt vengeaunce of God for the innocente bloud which they had ſhed. So that certayne noble men, and alſo of the common ſort were ſlayne in greate number whyche came by heapes to this warre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CONCERNING</hi> the <hi>Sanſerreans</hi> wee haue ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howe that the Lorde <hi>Chaſtre</hi> leauing off to aſſalte the towne any more, intrenched the ſame rounde about, and made diuers bulwarkes and rampiers, placing in the ſayd trenches a very ſtrong garriſon to hemme and incloſe the towneſmen on euery ſide: Alſo we ſayde that by reaſon of their negligence in prouiding corne &amp; vittayle aforehand, ther enſued a wonderfull &amp; almoſt incredible famine, whiche the tranſlator thoughte good to ſet down at large as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is deſcribed by <hi>monſ. Lyrre,</hi> who ſerued in the towne euen vntill the ſame was yelded vp, as is ſayd before.</p>
            <p>Therefore whereas in the moneth of March vittayles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to waxe ſhorte and ſkante within <hi>Sanſerre,</hi> and ſpecially Beefe and ſuch other fleſhe whiche men vſe to eate ordinaryly. The xix. daye of the ſame moneth a Carthorſe of <hi>Monſieur le Vailly de Iohanneau</hi> gouernour of the ſaid towne, being killed with the ſhot of a Canon at the aſſault as he was drawing of fagots and Earth to the Rampire was cut in peeces, ſlayne, carried away, and eaten by the common people and the poore laborers and handicrafts men, who made report to euery man that they neuer eat better beefe in their liues, which thing made diuers that could not eaſily come by other fleſhe to be deſirous of it: who y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth day of April next folowing killed an Aſſe, which was ſold preſently for .iiij. pound <hi>Turnois</hi> a quarter, &amp; fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be good meat of al ſuch as did eat of it boiled, roſted, or baked, &amp; ſpecally y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuer of it being roſted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cloues was like the liuer of Veale. Truely at the firſt, ſome feeding more of it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17727:73"/> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were wont to do of other meates, were ſory that they had eaten of it. But within few dayes after, and before the .xx. day of the ſame moneth: it was a common food eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the dayntieſt ſorte.</p>
            <p>And although there were many Aſſes and Mulets in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerre</hi> by reaſon of the high ſituation of the place, whiche was il for Charets to come vnto: yet within one moneth they were all killed, diſpatched and eaten in ſted of Beefe, ſo as ther was not one left.</p>
            <p>By meanes whereof hauing made too greate waſt of theyr fleſh, in hope they ſhould not haue indured ſo long a ſeege: they were very ſory afterward y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the matter no better.</p>
            <p>In the month of May they began alſo to kill their horſes, which thing was the cauſe that aſwell to preuente the ſtinche and infection that mighte enſue, by reaſon of the panches and dung in ſeuerall houſes where euery man killed them at theyr pleaſure, as alſo to take order that the fleſh ſhoulde not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured ſo in corners nor ſold at exceſſiue price, the councel toke order that the Horſes ſhould bee killed and ſold in the ordinary ſhambles,<note place="margin">Euery ſouſe is .i. peny ob. Engliſhe.</note> appoynting the fleſhe of a fat horſe to bee ſolde but at iij. ſowſes the pound, and the leane at two ſowſes, which thing was don by reaſon of the extreame couetouſneſſe of certayne perſons, who felt not the hand of God fierce vpon them in that ſo miſerable time.</p>
            <p>For as ſhall bee declared heereafter in Iuly and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Auguſt, a pounde of Horſefleſh was ſolde at eygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, twenty, and two and twenty ſowſes. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the order and pollicy that could be taken, the beſt chepe was betweene tenne and thirteene ſowſes the pound, and the offals thereof were yet much more exceſſiuely deerer, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thyng did maruellouſly greeue the poore people. And I muſt heere tell you that horſe fleſhe (by the reporte of ſuche as taſted well of them both) is better than the fleſhe of Aſſes or Mules. For although it be more neſh rawe than ſodden: yet is it more fyrme and ſubſtantiall, and it agreeth better with the nature of it to be boyled than roſted. And if a man
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17727:73"/> will make good pottage with it, whether he put it into the pot freſh or poudred, he muſt giue it longer ſeething, than to beef. The taſte of it is ſomewhat like Porke, but yet ſomewhat nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the taſte of Beefe. If a man wyll bake it, he muſt neyther perboyle it, nor ſeeth it before, but ſeaſon it with ſalte, vineger, and pepper, and let it bake ſokingly in the cruſt. The fat of it is like the fat of Porke, and byteth not the delicate tong, and the lyuer is yet delicater than the reſt.</p>
            <p>But the famine increaſed more and more, and the Cats alſo hauing their turne, were within a little while all killed, ſlayne and eaten vp as Conyes, in ſomuch that the ſtore and increaſe of them fayled, and in leſſe than fiftiene dayes they were ſolde at .xv. ſowſes the quarter.</p>
            <p>Moreouer by reaſon of the penury wherewith many men were pinched, they fell to catching of Rats, Moles, and Mice, and the hunger that preſſed them, made them to deuiſe, inuent, and finde out all manner of traps: and ye ſhould haue ſeene the poore children glad and well apayed when they had caught any Mice, which they broyled vpon the coales moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without fleaing or bulking of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By reaſon of the great ſcarcitie of them, men did rather deuour them than eate them, and there was neyther tayle of beaſt, feete nor ſkynne, whiche was not ſuddenly gathered together, to ſerue for ſuſtenance to a great number of needy people.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that were not dryuen to ſo great neceſſitie, did eate roſted Rattes, howbeit, they are much better ſtewed. Yea and which thing (I would not haue beleeued, without I had had experience of it, or at leaſt wiſe were well aſſured of it.) Dogges were not ſpared, but without lothing or miſlyking, they were killed as ordinarily for meate, as men kyll ſheepe at other times. Some of them were ſnetched, kylled, and ſolde for an hundred ſowſes, and for ſixe poundes <hi>Turnoys</hi> a peece,<note place="margin">The pounde <hi>Turn ys,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lings ſixe pence Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> and it was noueltie to buy a quarter of a Dogge for .xx. and xxv. ſowſes: ſuche as did eate of them ſayde, that the fleſhe of them is verie good, and they made great cheare with the feete, the inwards and bellyes of them ſtewed with ſpices and herbs.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17727:74"/> In ſo much that the heads of Calues, Horſes, and Lambs, and the legges of Greyhoundes and Houndes, being roſted, were thought to be fine meate, and eaten as the inwardes of an Hare. But ſpecially the yong ſucking and the little whelpes, were taken for yong Rabbet ſuckers. Neuertheleſſe (to ſay what I knowe, by taſting thereof my ſelfe) Dogges fleſhe is very flaſhe and wallowiſh ſweete.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of Iuly, when there remayned yet twentie Horſes of ſeruice, which were ſpared againſt the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt extremitie, the belly whiche hath no eares, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie the Scholemiſtreſſe of cunning, made dyuers men to try whether the ſkyns of Oxen, Kyne, Sheepe, and other cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, whiche hung a drying in mennes ſtore houſes and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, could ſupply the place of theyr bodyes. And out of doubt, after that men had aſſayed it, and well waſhed, ſcraped, and ſcalded them: they found ſuch ſauour in them, that as ſoone as it was knowne, as many as had any ſkynnes, dreſſed them after the foreſayde manner, and roaſted them vppon a Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyron like Trypes. Such as had any ſuet, greace, or tallow, made Fricaſes of them in a pot, and other ſome dyd eate them with vinegar.</p>
            <p>Howbeit aboue all ſkynnes, the Calues ſkynnes were founde to be exceeding good, and I haue eaten of them ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycate, that if I had not beene tolde of it, I woulde haue thought that I had eaten of the beſte Trypes in the worlde. Afterwarde, the ſkynnes of Horſes and of all other beaſtes came into the play: and the eares that remayned vpon the Aſſes ſkynnes, were not lefte behynde, but were helde and eſteemed to be as tender and good meate as Hogges ſouſe. The beſte manner of dreſſing all ſortes of Hydes and ſkinnes, is not to pyll them and ſcalde them (as I ſayde afore) but to nayle them, and ſtrayne them vpon a boorde, and ſo to ſindge and ſcrapt off the hayre of them more eaſily, as men do ſindge Bacon hogges. Afterwarde they muſt lye ſoaking a daye or twayne in water, and the water muſt be chaunged often times, and then they muſt be dreaſt and ſodden, as we dreſſed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17727:74"/> them at oure returne from a voyage whiche I made into the lande of <hi>Brazilie,</hi> called <hi>America,</hi> in the yeere of oure Lorde 1558. where hauing continued fyue monethes vpon the ſea, without ſetting foote on lande, when as the hunger laſted ſtill, whiche we had indured by the ſpace of a moneth before, we were dryuen to eate the drye Hydes of beaſtes, as bigge as a Bullocke of a yeere olde, whiche the wylde people call a <hi>Tappirowſon,</hi> for we dyd but lay them vppon the coales, and had not the ſkill to ſoften them, as men dyd the dry ſkynnes at <hi>Sanſerre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The dearth was ſo great, that one foote of leather, or one pounde wayght of any maner of beaſtes ſkynnes whatſoeuer they were, was ſolde for twelue or fyfteene Sowſes, and ſome ſkynnes were retayled for more than thyrtie Frankes,<note place="margin">A Franke or pounde is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lings ſixe pence Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them vpon Tallyes and Skores, as in a Caterie or vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualing houſe. And for as much as the prouiſion of ſkinnes fayled, by reaſon of the narowe ſearche of ſuche as were pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with hunger: The finer witted ſorte beganne to worke maiſteries with Parchment, which taking good ſucceſſe, made the people fall to it as to other things before, in ſo muche that not onely the ſkynnes of cleane Parchment were eaten, but alſo the Letters, Scrolles, and Bookes, as well prynted as in written hande, were eaten without any ſtoppe, and the oldeſt and auncienteſt Bookes of an hundred or ſixſcore yeeres olde, were ſought out euerie where, and eaten vp wythout ſeething of them.</p>
            <p>The manner of the dreſſing of them, was to ſteepe them a daye or twaine as neede required, chaunging the water of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to ſcrape them with a knyfe, as I tolde you afore of the ſkynnes. Then they boyled them a day or twaine till they became ſoft and tender, which was perceiued by this, that in drawing them out, and in breaking of them with ones fingers, they were ſeene to be clammy, and men fryed them as Tripes. Other ſome boyled them with Hearbes and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces after the maner of a hotchpotch. Other ſome broyled them vpon the coales.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:17727:75"/>
            <p>And I haue ſeene men eate the verie letters, in ſo much that the printing and written hande appeared ſtill, and a man myght haue read the morſelles in the platter, when they were readie to be eaten. And to omit nothing wherewyth the famiſhed people might be relieued, the horſe hooues that were caſt vpon the dunghilles, and the olde hornes and clees of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and Kine, being gathered vp in the ſtreates, were eaten and deuoured of diuers folke, who left nothing behynde them among the dung, no more than if Duckes and Hennes had ſcraped and pecked them, and the very hornes hornes of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes were not forgotten: nowe if the ſtreates and lanes were ſo narrowly ſought and ſearched, to fill mennes bellyes with the things that Swine and dogges would haue refuſed, and made none account of: the houſes alſo were ranſacked throughout, wher any moiſt or ſauerly ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was thought poſſible to be had.</p>
            <p>And for the better verifying of the thing that I ſpake at the beginning, the headſtalles, raines, poytrels, croupers, and all other horſeharneſſe, ſpecially of Whitleather, howe olde ſo euer they were, were dreſſed, ſodden, broyled and fryed. And ye ſhould haue ſeene al kynd of dreſſing of them vpon the ſtalles, where the retaylers of ſuche victuals ſolde them very deare. Alſo the yong children that had any leather gyrdles, flocked together, and broyling them vpon the coales, brake their faſte with them, as it had bene with Chitterlings made of guts. The greaſie leatherne aprons of Shoomakers, and other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and the ſynnes of Oxen and other beaſtes, that had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued foure or fiue yeeres for wanties and packſaddles, vpon Aſſes and Mules, and for ſuch other vſes, were put to the ſame purpoſe. Moreouer the leather Bottels, wherein vineger had hung a long whyle, the feete of Stagges, Hindes, and Gotes, whereat kayes were hanged, and the feete of great Swyne were not forgotten, but being boyled, roaſted, and fryed, dyd ſerue many men for ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>This is not all, for the pilches made of olde leather, whiche the Vinedreſſers of the towne vſed in plaſhing the Vines, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17727:75"/> the olde ſhooſoules were alſo ſodden and eaten. Furthermore the parings and ſcraps of poyntes, and the ſhreddings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Pedlery ſtuffe, were not caſt vpon the dunghils, but were fryed as Tripes. The ſkinnes of Shepe, Gotes, Lambs, and other things that were to be conueyed to Fraunce, vnto <hi>Lions</hi> and other places, notwithſtanding, the leatherſellers had dyed them, ſerued in ſteade of ſteakes of mutton, and in ſteade of guttes to make puddings in, and ſuche other Galimaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys made of ſuch ſcrapings and parings, wherewith they fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them together with hearbes and ſpices, and ſold them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deare: which thing I ſpeake to make you perceyue that no maner of thing that could be found like the things aforeſayd, hauing any moyſture, taſte, or ſauour, were lefte behynde. As for hearbes, they that had any Gardens, made more account of them, than of a good Farme.</p>
            <p>For beſides that, they founde them ſelues with them, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them after all faſhyons that they coulde deuiſe, if any of them had hearbes to ſell, (and ſpecially myngling them with a little Bran) they made breade of them. If any man had of it to ſell, he had what he would aſke for it, and there was not a leaſe of Colwortes giuen for leſſe than a Liart or four De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers. Other hearbes were ſolde after the ſame rate,<note place="margin">A Liard is the fourth part of a ſouſe A Deniere is the twelfth part of a ſouſe</note> and the poore people eate greedily, of al ſorts of rootes and wild weeds, yea and euen of Hemlocke rootes, through the eating whereof, aboue a hundred perſons became ſwolne, and were poyſoned and dyed. And yet notwithſtanding, if a man that ſawe them gathering of them, and plucking them vp, had ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the danger wherin they did caſt themſelues, he had ſpoken to deaf eares, for their bellyes wold not conſent nor hearken to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paradine</hi> in his Story of our time, ſayth that in the dearth which fell in this realme of Fraunce, in the yere of our Lorde God. 1528. many men poyſoned themſelues with the rootes of Hemlocke. And <hi>Matheolus</hi> in his Commentarie vpon <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides</hi> ſaith, that he ſawe a countryman and his wife almoſt out of their wits, by eating of it vnwares.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of Iuly, when corne was ſo ſcarce in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17727:76"/> 
               <hi>Sanſerre,</hi> that more than three parts of the people had no bread at all to eate. Such as had or could come by any Linſeede, or Hayſeede, or by the Hay it ſelf, or other ſeedes that were neuer earſt thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be eaten, did grinde them and poune the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in a morter, and made breade of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according alſo as they did of all other ſorts of hearbes, yea &amp; euen of the ſtraw of wheate brayed, pilled, ſteeped, and finely ſhred. Alſo Nutſhels were ſtamped in morters of yron, and being beaten into pouder, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for Meale to make paſte &amp; breade of. Moreouer, men did alſo bray Slats, &amp; made bread of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtieped in water, ſalt and vinegar. The old refuſe of talow, candles, and ſmeery greace, and olde fat &amp; kitchinſtuffe, ſerued to make breweſſe &amp; fritters.</p>
            <p>The .viij. day of Iuly they began to fall to the reſidewe of the Horſes that were left, whiche were ſoone killed and eaten, and they were ſold (by report) at theyr weight of Golde: in ſo much that the laſt weeke of the ſayd moneth, a pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of horſe fleſhe was ſolde for twenty and two and twenty ſowſes, the heads of them at .vij. pound, tenne Sowſes a peece, the feete at ſixe pound, which is .xxx. Sowſes a Foot, a pounde of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at .xxviij. ſowſes, &amp; a Liuer was found to wey wel neere ten pound, which amounted to .xiiij. pound the whole Liuer. The hart of a horſe was ſold at .xxviij. ſowſes the pounde, and there were of them that weyed more than ſeuen pound, ſo as the whole hart came almoſt to ten pound. The Skinne was ſolde for meate at .viij. pound and .x. pound, and the inwards at .xv. ſowſes the pound: whereof many folkes made Sawſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche were founde to be better than the Sawſages that are made of Hogs fleſh. And a pound of the Greace was ſolde at thirty ſowſes. Howbeit yee ſhall heare yet a more owgly thing: which is, that the bloud of a Horſe made in Puddings, (wherein was a fifth or ſixth parte of herbes) weying fortie pound, were ſold for .xiiij. ſowſes the pound, whiche amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to .xxviij. pound <hi>Turnoys.</hi> And therefore I cannot but ſay that the vnſatiable couetouſneſſe of ſuch as ſolde them ſo deere to the poore ſoules that were too much pinched otherwiſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhall not ſcape vnpuniſhed. For (as it hath bene tolde them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17727:76"/> often times by Gods word) the end of ſuch bloodſuckers is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to burſt when they be once full. It ſeemeth that there could not any thing be added to ſet out the miſerable ſtate of a towne beſeeged, and ſo narrowly beſet and hemmed in on all ſides with ſtrong Bulwarkes, and trenches, as it was very harde and in manner impoſſible to goe out of it or into it, and much more to bring or conuey any vittels into it.</p>
            <p>For alas, the ſame thing fell out in <hi>Sanſerre,</hi> whiche is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Prophet Ieremy in the fourth Chapter and fifth verſe of hys Lamentations, to haue happened in the ſeege of Ieruſalem, where ſuche as had bene woont to feede of fine and dayntie meates, periſhed for hungre in the ſtreetes, and yet were fayne to eate the dung of men, and other beaſtes. For I am able to ſaye that the excrements, dung and offals were gathered vp and eaten, and men were ſeene to fyll theyr diſſhes with dung and to feede of it, and they ſayde they founde it as good as Bread, and moreouer they gathered vp all kynde of fylth and vncleanneſſe in the ſtreetes, ſcraping abroade the dunghils to ſeeke for olde bones, olde hornes and other things incredible to ſuch as ſaw it not, and which had bin able to haue poiſoned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not onely in eating them, but alſo euen with the ſtinch of them.</p>
            <p>But O eternal God, behold yet further the fulneſſe of gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for as he proteſteth in the .xxvj. of Leuiticus and in the .xxviij. of Deuter. that if they diſobeyed his worde and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, he woulde bring them to ſuche an afterdeale, that when they were beſeeged the mothers ſhoulde eate theyr owne Children: the poore people of <hi>Sanſerre</hi> hauing not yet throughly profited by the knowledge that God ſent them, nor fared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better by his ſcourges and chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, fel to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an ougly barbarous &amp; vnkindly crime w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in their wals.</p>
            <p>For the .xxj. of Iuly it was diſcouered &amp; complayned of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Vinekeeper named <hi>Potard,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eugenie</hi> his wife, and an olde woman that dwelt with them named <hi>Philip Ienillie</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Lumeroy</hi> had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, braines, Liuer &amp; intrails of a yong daughter of theirs about the age of three yeeres,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17727:77"/> which had dyed of hunger for want of foode, which happened not without the great aſtoniſhment and terrour of all ſuch as heard of it. And ſurely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I my ſelf, going to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of their aboade, had ſeene the bones and ſkull of the heade of the ſayde dead childe dreſſed and gnawed, and the eares of it eaten, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether alſo with the tong of a finger thickneſſe, ſodden and ready to be eaten, at the verie time when they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: and the two thighes, legs and feete, in a kettle with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, ſpices, and ſalt, ready to be ſet vpon the fire to boyle: and the two ſhoulders, armes, and handes, cleauing together, but yet clyued and opened in the bulke of the breſt, ready likewiſe to be eaten: I was ſo abaſhed and diſmayed at it, that all my body quaked. For although I had dwelled ten monthes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among the beaſtly <hi>Americanes,</hi> in the lande of <hi>Brazilie,</hi> where I ſawe them oftentimes eate mans fleſhe, for they did eate the priſoners whom they tooke in the warres: yet did it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trouble my mynd ſomuch to ſee them do ſo, as it vexed me to behold the ſayd rufull ſight, the like wherof (I beleeue) was neuer earſt ſeene in our realme of Fraunce.</p>
            <p>The father, the mother, and the olde woman being taken and put in priſon, confeſſed the fact without denyall. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid it was greatly to hir griefe, that hir childe was ſo elit in peeces, and that where as ſhe had put vp the body in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſheete, and left it vpon a beere, while ſhe went into the towne about a certaine buſineſſe, minding to haue buried it when ſhe came againe: at hir retune, ſhe founde it vnlapped out of the ſheete that ſhe had wound it in, the body of it ript, and the bowels taken out of the belly, and the head, purtenance and tong boyling in a pot vpon the fire, which thing ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hir huſbande, and hee tolde hir that the ſayde <hi>Philip</hi> had moued him to doe it, teſting him that it were pitie to let the fleſh rot in the ground, and moreouer, that the liuer was very good to heale a ſwelling which he had, and thervpon they eate the broth of it, and gaue hir likewiſe of it alſo, who did eat of it to. The olde woman dyed the ſame morning in the pryſon. And for as muche as the Iudges founde by ſearche, that this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17727:77"/> ouerbeaſtly crueltie was committed rather of wantonneſſe than by extremitie of famine, and that the ſelfſame daye afore the ſayd <hi>Potard</hi> and his wife and the olde woman had giuen them in almes a meſſe of herbpottage and a qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of wine, for there was as then no talke of bread: To the intent to cut off the practiſing of ſuche horrible deedes within the Towne, the ſayd <hi>Potard</hi> the father was condemned to be burnt quicke, and his wife to be hanged, beeyng fyrſt drawen vppon a Hardle to the place of execution togither with the body of the olde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which was yet vnburied. Vpon the mans words in that he tolde his wife that the olde woman had perſwaded hym to eate of his owne child, it came to my remembrance how I had marked that the old women of the wild <hi>Americanes</hi> aforeſaid, are more deſirous, greedy and longing to eate of mans fleſhe, than the men, or the yong women, or the Children are.</p>
            <p>For when they ſee any Priſoner taken, they neuer leaue till they haue cauſed him to be ſlayne with ſuch ſolemnitie as they obſerue there, whiche I haue deſcribed in the diſcourſe that I haue made concerning that Voiage. When the fleſhe is layde vpon a <hi>Bouean</hi> as they tearme it, that is to ſay vpon a Gridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of a three foote high, they throng about it to licke vp the fat that droppeth downe the ſtaues of the Gridiron, ſaying in their tung <hi>Vgaton,</hi> that is to ſay, good, good.</p>
            <p>And I beleeue that the old folkes deſirouſneſſe to eate mans fleſh after that ſort, is for that they woulde by that meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come yong againe. But I will leaue the diſcourſing of that matter to Phiſitions, and declare vnto you for a concluſion of this rufull Story, that about the .xxv. of Iune, one beyng ſore pinched with the rage of hunger, aſked of me whether that in that extreme neceſſitie it were euil or offenſiue to God, to eate of a dead mans buttocke that he liked well of or no. Whyche demaunde ſeemed ſo odiouſe vnto me, that leauing him in the dout and remorſe of his owne conſcience, I tolde him that the Wolues and wild beaſtes did not eate one another.</p>
            <p>In the moneth of Iune, by reaſon of the greate dearth and ſcarcitie of vittailes, many poore people were thruſt out of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17727:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> Towne, which thing was done many times after. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſuffered to paſſe the trenches and ſtandings of theyr enimies that beſeeged them, nor to returne into the Towne agayne: were fayne to eate the buddes of Vines and Mulbery trees, gray Snayles and redde Snayles, and weedes: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long pining, the moſt part of them died betweene the ſayd trenches and the towne ditches. Howbeit among other piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, one is, that a Vinekeeper and his wife were found dead togeather in their Vineyard, and two yong Children of theirs lay crying and wayling by them, whereof the yonger was not paſt a ſixe weekes olde, whiche were ſoughte out and ſent for by a noble Lady of the Towne, who did put them out to nurſe, or elſe they had dyed out of hand. And as there dyed many in the Vineyards by the counterſcarf, and in the town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diches: ſo there died many moe in the houſes, and they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled downe thicke in the ſtreetes, in ſomuche that ſome tymes there were buried .xx or .xxx. in a day.</p>
            <p>But ſpecially the Children that were vnder twelue yeeres olde dyed almoſt euery chone. I beleeue that the naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and heate that is in youth, wherthrough they be alwayes deſirous to feede, bycauſe their ſtomacks are warme and better able to digeſt than elder folkes, and therewithall haue not lyke patience and diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haſted the death of the ſayd ſilly childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which lay drawing of their breath, euen til their bones peered out of their Skinnes, &amp; made wofull mone, crying out w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table voice before they yelded vp their Ghoſt, alas we ſtarue for hungre.</p>
            <p>That mans hart muſt haue bin harder than the ſtony rocke, &amp; his eares deafer than the Adamant, which ſhuld not haue bin moued at the hearing of ſuch things. There was a boy of ten yeeres olde, who lying in the pangs and extremitie of deathe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard &amp; ſaw his father and mother lamenting by hym &amp; handling his armes &amp; legs which were as drie as a ſticke, ſayde vnto them: Why weep ye thus to ſee me dye for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger? I aſke no Bread of you, for I knowe ye haue it not. But ſith it is Gods will to haue me die ſo, it behoueth you to take it in good
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17727:78"/> worth, did not the holy men Iob and Lazarus ſuffer hunger as well as I? haue not I red of it in my Bible? And ſo hauing made his poore father and mothers hart to cleaue and theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels to irne and ſorow ſo much the more, bycauſe they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that God had giuen him ſo noble a mind: he gaue vp the Ghoſt and yeelded his ſoule vnto God.</p>
            <p>The .xxx. day of Iuly and more than .xv. dayes before, yee ſhould haue ſeene great numbers of poore folke lye ſtaruing in the ſtreetes, with griſly countenaunce reſembling rather dead bodyes of earth than liuing perſons, which with an hollowe &amp; piteouſe voyce made lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table mone, ſaying. Alas, if I might eat but one bit of bread of hey I ſhuld do wel. Alas, although I had any chaffe remaining (for ſometimes they had chaffe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them) yet were I not able to pill it and to temper it, for I am ouer far ſpent. The wretched mothers carying the bodyes of their dead Children to the Churchyard (and dragging thoſe after them by the hande that were left aliue) woulde ſaye vnto them, alas my poore Babe it will not be long ere thou folowe thy brother or ſiſter that goes afore thee.</p>
            <p>Neuer was there any thing heard of more pitifull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable. But the greateſt greefe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nipped ſuch as heard &amp; ſaw theſe things, was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had not for the moſt part wherwith to remedie it, but wer fain to behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſore &amp; yet had not any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin or plaiſter to lay vnto it. Neuertheleſſe, euen in the midſt of this great diſtreſſe &amp; calamitie, ye ſhuld haue ſeene wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie, in ſomuch that they cried out vnto God ſtill, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Alas Lord delyuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcourges &amp; rods wherewith thou doeſt iuſtly beate and chaſtiſ vs for our ſinnes ſake. Haue pitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy poore people, &amp; in the midſt of thy wrath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy mercy.

            <p>About the .xv. of Iuly and ſo foorth to the ende of the ſame moneth, and the beginning of Auguſt. the penurie grewe ſo greate that they began to kill the reſt of the Horſes that had bene reſerued for the ſaide extremitie. For the outcry of the people, and ſpecially of the Souldiers (howbeit that ſome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17727:79"/> which were moſt needy cryed not) was ſo greate by reaſon of the famin, that the owners of them had muche a doo to keepe them from them. Neuertheleſſe they ſolde them exceedyngly deere. For the horſes that were killed in <hi>Sanſerre</hi> to be eaten, which could not haue bin ſolde at other times for ten crownes a peece, were now ſolde for threeſcore, foureſcore, yea and a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred crownes a peece, and ſome at a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred and fifty crownes. Laſt of all there was kylled a Gote, whiche was ſolde at tenne pound <hi>Turnois</hi> the quarter, which amounted in al to fyue and fiftie pound, as the woman that cauſed it to be killed confeſſed. Herewithall the bloud alſo was ſolde at ſixteene or ſeuenteene Crownes.</p>
            <p>Alſo ſixe Kine, and all the reſt of the Gotes that had bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reſerued to haue milke to feede Children with, were killed likewiſe, and I beleeue there was not left paſt one Cow alyue within the whole Towne. A pound of the ſayd Cowe Beefe was ſolde for thirteene and fourteene Sowſes, and for twentie Sowſes.</p>
            <p>The eyghteenth day of Auguſt, a pound of the Tripes was ſolde for tenne Shillings <hi>Turnoys,</hi> where as in time of peace, halfe a pound was worth no more but a Liard. A pounde of newe Corne (whiche the morrowe after that they were ſure of peace was ſold for ſixe Blanks) was nowe fold for eyghteene Sowſes and eyght Deniers, whereas it had bin ſold afore for xxv. ſowſes: and fiue quarters of Gotes fleſh was ſold for .xx. Sowſes. A Hen was ſolde for a Crowne and three frankes: and a Cocke or a Pullet for as much: and an Egge for fyue or ſixe ſowſes. During the moneth of Iuly and the firſte part of Auguſt, for aſmuche as there were certayne feeldes of Corne betweene the Towne and the Trenches of the enimies, ſuche as were diſperſed in the Vineyards, (namely ſuch as had bene put out of the Towne) togyther with certayne venturers and others that ſtole out in the nights, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as cloſely as they could in greate danger of theyr lyues, to cut downe and gather vp the ſayde Corne. But fewe of them eſcaped, bycauſe that they which kepte the Trenches hauing their Scoutes ſet by them,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17727:79"/> diſcouered them immediately, and ſome diſpatched them with Hargubuſſe ſhot, ſo as they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t no more out of the field. The little that was brought home was ſold exceedingly deere: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that a little ſheafe wherin there was not paſt an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Corne, was ſold for .xij. or .xv. ſowſes, and it was ſeene that fiue ſowſes were refuſed for fiftie eares of corne, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was he that coulde come by it for any price, how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it were.</p>
            <p>For we practiſed that which is ſayde in Iob, namely that a man wil giue ſkin for ſkin, and all that he hath for his life.</p>
            <p>The ſeaſon of ſowre grapes whereof many folkes lyued, came now in very good time. Some did eate them rawe, ſome baked in an Ouen, ſome boyled in water, and otherſome fryed and ſawced with Muſtard and ſpices.</p>
            <p>The ripe Bullaces and other wylde frutes that coulde bee gathered among the Vines and Buſhes about the Towne, were narrowly ſought for and ſolde at the pleaſure of ſuche as brought them. Alſo the Thiſtles ſerued vs in ſteede of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichoks, and Nettles in ſtede of Spinage. To conclude this ſmall diſcourſe, in leſſe than three moneths during the ſiege of <hi>Sanſerre,</hi> there was eaten moe than two hundred Horſes, Mares, Colts, Aſſes, Mules and other beaſts of burthen, ſo that of all the number that were in the Towne after the beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it, there was but one left alyue, in ſtede whereof there was ſlayne an Aſſe that was caught among the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of Auguſt the dearth and famine had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more than foure tymes as many in <hi>Sanſerre</hi> in ſixe weeks as the ſworde had done in ſeuen moneths and a halfe, duryng which time the ſeege laſted. For in the Muſter booke kepte of all the Souldiers and other people that were ſlayne from the begynning of the ſeege to the twentie of Auguſt, as well with ſhot of Canon and Hargubuſſe as otherwiſe, wer found but foureſcore and tenne: and I am ſure that the number of ſuch as died for hunger in the Towne and of ſuche as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe that were ſhut vp in the ſame, was more than foure
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17727:80"/> hundred perſons.</p>
            <p>Who would not quake now at the hearing of ſuch iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God executed vpon the towne of <hi>Sanſerre?</hi> For they that were beſeeged felt by experience how true the ſaying of the Prophet is, that ſuch as ſcape the Swoord ſhall be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with hunger, and that the hande of GOD (as the Pſalme writer ſayth) ſtretcheth out whether ſoeuer he liſteth. Neuertheleſſe let not ſuche as reade thys Booke thynke that they which were beſeeged in <hi>Sanſerre,</hi> were the wickeddeſt and moſt abhominable ſinners in the worlde. For although they acknowledge theyr ſynnes before God, and haue ſufficient warning to walke better in hys feare heereafter: yet is it not to be concluded, that ſuche as are chaſtiſed moſt roughly are therefore moſte wicked. For as it is ſayde in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Chylde whome the father loueth ſhall not be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Rod.</p>
            <p>And as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſayde to the Iewes of hys tyme. Thoſe vpon whome the Tower in <hi>Silo</hi> fell, and thoſe men whoſe bloud <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with theyr Sacrifice, were no greater ſinners than other men. But if they that haue knowledge of theſe things amend not theyr lyfe, they ſhall all periſhe miſerably. Whyche thyng I ſpeake by the way, to the intent that the ſeege and famin of <hi>Sanſerre</hi> may ſerue for an example, not only to ſuche as were at it, but alſo generally to all men, and ſpecially to thoſe that are Proteſtantes, who haue iuſtly loſt a parte of theyr libertie whiche they hadde to ſerue God openly, and ſo hathe almoſt the whole Realme, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vſed it not to theyr profyte. And therefore I muſt not reſt ſo muche vppon ſeconde cauſes, nor take vpon me to diſcourſe of diuers thinges that haue come to paſſe in thys Realme, within one yeere, againſt the intent of our King.</p>
            <p>For God who gouerneth all things by his wonderfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, hath guyded and directed the whole in ſuche wiſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſayth in his worde, that it is he that ſmiteth and maketh the wound, and it is he that healeth it againe There. is no more for vs to do, but to profit our ſelues by the things that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17727:80"/> are paſt, by amending our liues heereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IN</hi> theſe great extremities the chiefe gouernours of the towne knewe not what to doe, and to yeelde them ſelues into the hands of the enimie ſeemed vnto them more cruel than deathe it ſelfe: they had ſente meſſengers into dyuers places, to craue ayde and ſuccour of their fellowes, but in vayne. They which had ſome abilitie to helpe the miſerable beſeeged <hi>Sanſerreans,</hi> therefore refuſed to ayde them, not that they miſliked of theyr cauſe, or thought them woorthy of ſo greate miſeries: but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wanted money, the whiche in this vnhappy tyme was hard to come by. Notwithſtandyng, the Kings treaſure was ſpent in leuying bands of horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to deſtroy the remaynder of miſerable men. They whiche had a good wyll to helpe, were in ſo greate extremities, that being brought them ſelues into greate perill, were ſcarſe able to withſtande their aſſayling enimies. When they ſawe that theyr fyrſt meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers could not ſpeede of theyr purpoſe, they ſente agayne at the laſt (namely the .24. of Iuly) <hi>Monſ. Flore, Mine,</hi> and <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> the chiefe Captaynes, to prooue whether their preſence might preuayle more to get help &amp; ſuccors, than their fellowes had done before.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Rochelleans</hi> had made a peace with the King, withoute the knowledge of them of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and others of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> although they alſo were expreſly contayned in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants of agreemente. Notwithſtanding the Edict beyng read did not ſatiſfye them, but affyrmed, that the experiments of the former tymes reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with diuers murders, did proue, that theſe pacificatorie meanes were ſnares, to intercept and intangle thoſe with the pretence of peace, whome they coulde not by force of Armes, &amp; with warre ouercome. Therfore they thought good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and participate this matter with their fellowes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue it needefull to prouide for the ſame by a common aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Churches whiche were left. So that after tydings was brought vnto them of the Edict made, they ſente into the Armie a meſſenger to the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to giue him thanks on their behalfe, beſeeching him, that for ſo muche as the cauſe in hand was generall, and bycauſe it belonged to many of the reformed Religion to know theſe things in conuenient time, that he would giue them leaue to aſſemble them ſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a fit place, and that to the ſame ende he woulde graunt them his letters patents for their aſſurance.</p>
            <p>Theſe letters patents were graunted and made, and all they of the Religion, to whome knowledge might be gyuen, were warned to be at <hi>Milliaud</hi> in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Wherevpon there came many from all partes of the Realme, according as the tyme would ſuffer them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS</hi> was a notable occaſion to prouide for thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine time to come. For in this aſſembly they conſidered and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17727:82"/> ſcanned how they might order their affayres afterwarde: and ſo prouided for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues both lawes ciuill and alſo martiall.</p>
            <p>In the large prouince of <hi>Languedoc</hi> there are many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, the which were repleniſhed with a great number of the Religious, whiche helde diuers cities and Townes in ſundry parts of the ſame, hauing alſo amongſt them the Catholiques, in ſomuch that the keeping of thoſe places was very perillous, by reaſon that their enimies were ſo mixed with them.</p>
            <p>Therefore to the ende their affayres might euer afterwarde be ordred after a more firme &amp; conſtant maner, they appointed two generalties or Lieftenantſhips for the territorie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the whiche all the Religious of that prouince were contayned, namely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Liefetenantſhip of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and the Liefetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tſhip of <hi>Niſmes.

They apoynted to euery Liefetenantſhip a Liefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant which was ſome famous noble man. And they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of theſe Liefetenantſhips to endure, ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill war ſhould hold eyther ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly or ſecretly, that they might haue the chiefe authoritie in martiall affayres: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their power might be ſubiect to the iudgemente of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate. Euery cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey or dioceſſe had his ſenate, according to the ancient maner of <hi>France,</hi> and they continue in vſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that part, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto this day: theſe Senats they call par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtates. But the Liefetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tſhip, in the which many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes are contayned, is called the chiefe or high Senate, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che conſiſteth of certayne choice men out of euery countrey or ſhyre: notwithſtanding ſo, that the ſentences of euery Senate in matters of great waight were examined and ſtraightly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlooked. It was alſo ordeyned that by the decree of that high Senate or court the Lefetenant ſhuld rule and gouerne thoſe affayres which belonged vnto the warre. Theſe Liefetenants had a certayne ſtipend aſſigned vnto them, the whole rule and charge of the treaſure belonged to the Senate, the Liefetenant by his office hauing nothing to do with the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:17727:83"/>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> to mayntaine warre, they tooke theſe wayes: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the people might be reſtrayned, ſo muche as might be from martiall robbing, and that countreys might not be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſpoyled: they charge the townes and villages by a writ out of the kings Excheaker to pay tribute, yea and thoſe townes alſo in the whiche the Catholikes inhabited, lenying ſuche a ſumme as might be ſufficient to mayntaine garrizons in them. They call for a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribution. Thus they were gently intreated, which payed the commaunded tribute: huſbandry alſo was permitted and mayntained. So that thoſe places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by the Catholikes, did obey, for feare of robbing, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and burning. Thus they went about to cut off all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of martiall libertie, ſo much as might be taken away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many outrageous furies of warre: and they proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the continuance of longer warre, if ſo be no reaſonable and indifferent condition were offered by the king. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, they gathered the tythes and reuenues of the prieſtes, and appoynted collectors for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Hytherto all occaſion to holde warre, ſeemed after ſo great ſlaughters of men made, to be taken away from the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but this way which they nowe deuiſed, brought to paſſe, that they of the Religion were able to mayntaine garrizons in diuers places: the which when neede required, being come together in one, by the commaundement of the Lieftenant, woulde haue made a ſufficient armie: by this meanes alſo the catholikes power was weakned: <hi>Vicount Pauline</hi> was made Lieftenant of <hi>Montauban:</hi> and <hi>monſ. Sanroman,</hi> (of whome we ſpake before) being come from <hi>Switzerland</hi> to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> was made Lieftenant of the ſame, after he had taken his othe. The comming of <hi>Sanroman</hi> brought to paſſe, that the diſcordes of the captaynes diſagreeing among them ſelues hitherto, being appeaſed, their affayres had more happy ſucceſſe in <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and in the cities adioyning therevnto: all men obeying with all their heartes the commaundement giuen by him, and alſo by the Senate.</p>
            <p>Therefore nowe at the laſt neceſſitie and experience, the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17727:83"/> ſchoolemiſtreſſe of fooles taught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religious for their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary defence, a new kind of order, not vſed in the time of the former warres, and more conuenient: And theſe things wer handled very well in the aſſembly or conuocation at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus prouided to eſtabliſh a certaine order, the men of <hi>Languedoc</hi> alſo determined in this conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to require certaine things of the king for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of peace: for the former Edict did not ſatiſfie them, as we ſaide before, neither did the name of peace ſo moue them by and by, that without conſideration and reſpect all conditions were receiued, bycauſe the light credit of the Princes afore time, taught them to beware.</p>
            <p>Therefore they ſente vnto the king, <hi>Monſ. Yolet, Philip, Cherenac,</hi> and others whiche were actiue and prudent men. The ſumme of their meſſage was, To giue thanks vnto the king for ſingular good will, which he declared that he had to eſtabliſhe peace in his kingdome. That the ſame remedy was ſo neceſſarie, the kingdome by ſo long warres being in decay and almoſt ouerthrowen, that it could not be any longer deferred without preſent deſtruction. That they were minded to ſhew all obedience to their Lord &amp; king. But bycauſe the tragicall and lamentable memorie of the murders lately committed on S. Bartholmewes daye, doth ſhewe how dangerous a thing it is for the king theyr ſoueraigne to be ruled by the euill counſayles of wicked counſaylers: they moſt humbly beſeeched his maieſtie not to thinke it ſtrange that they, to whom it ſpecially belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſought the moſt conuenient wayes for the eſtabliſhing of peace. That it was lately broughte to paſſe, that the king by the practiſes of euill counſaylers, contrary to hys good nature, declared him ſelfe by his publique letters, to be the author and chiefe cauſe of that wicked fact, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che notwithſtanding a fewe dayes before he openly dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: the contrary ſhew whereof was too ſhamefull in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17727:84"/> ſight of al nations. That they were perſwaded of his own good will towards them: but they greatly feared, leaſt his mind ſhoulde be led by his counſaylers as aforetime: and that therfore they would prouide for them ſelues, and ſeeke to ſaue their liues and the liues of their friendes, beeyng taught by the pitifull example of their fellowes.</p>

            <p>Theſe ſeemed to bee large petitions: and in very deede their ſpeech to the king exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded farther, in ſo much that the Queene ſaide in diſpleaſure and anger, That the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> him ſelfe if he were aliue, and were euen in the very middeſt of the kingdome with twenty thouſand horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and fiue hundred thouſand footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; had alſo in his hands

And that as the authority to chooſe kings, ſo alſo the power to diſplace and depoſe them from their rule, was in old time in the handes of the ſtates of the people &amp; in the publique aſſembly of the Realm. Therefore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kings wer created in <hi>France</hi> by fyrme lawes, &amp; not tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ordeyned, with free authoritie &amp; power to do what ſoeuer them liſteth. For the which matter he bringeth many examples, namely of the two <hi>Childerickes,</hi> which kings were depoſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome by the decree of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtates: of <hi>Theoderic</hi> which was diſplaced with <hi>Ebroin</hi> his Lord great maſter: of <hi>Chilperic,</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the groſſe, alſo of <hi>Ottho</hi> which was choſen king in ſtede of <hi>Charles</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſtutter: and he taketh the credite of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and moſt vrgent cauſes, out of the very midſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſtorie.

And firſt of al concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating or diſplacing of a king: ſecondly, concerning peace &amp;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17727:87"/> warre, and common lawes: thirdly, concerning greate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, high offices, and gouernments of the common welth: Fourthly, concerning the aſſigning of the patrimonie in part to the children of the king being deceaſed, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the appointing of dowry to daughters: finally, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning al thoſe things which appertayne to the weale pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique. The power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd aſſembly of States was ſuch (ſaieth he) that without the authoritie or ſentence of the ſame, the king coulde determine nothing, but muſt folowe the authoritie and will of the States: which ſaid authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and will, were called <hi>The decrees of the ſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now when as this kingdom of <hi>France</hi> hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt a thouſand &amp; two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeeres, ther are ſaid to be in al this time only three houſes of kings, that is to ſay, of the <hi>Merouins,</hi> who taking their originall of <hi>Meroue,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtock two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred fourſcore &amp; three yeres: of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louins,</hi> who ſpringing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Charles</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great grew in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtocke three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thirty &amp; ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeres: &amp; of <hi>Capenites,</hi> who begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> haue now held y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred &amp; foureſcore yeres.

And then hee proueth by many examples, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the royal dignitie ſtood fyrme by the decree of the States in the times of the firſte raigne both of the <hi>Merouins,</hi> &amp; alſo of the <hi>Charlouins,</hi> &amp; was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued alſo in the houſe of the <hi>Capenites.</hi> And firſt by that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie celebrated and made famous with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the French hiſtories, and with the great warres which roſe of the ſame, betweene <hi>Philip Valoys,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> borne of <hi>Iſabel</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Charles.</hi> Who, when king <hi>Charles</hi> the fayre, dyed without heires male, contended for the kingdome. When the matter grew thus to contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it pleaſed the States to preferre <hi>Philip Valoys</hi> being of royall line, to whom the kingdom was adiudged. Another example he broughte from the lamentab e tyme of King
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17727:88"/> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ioyning battayle with the Engliſh men neare vnto <hi>Poictiers,</hi> was taken &amp; carried priſoner into <hi>England.</hi> So great calamitie being receyued, the hope was left in the authoritie of the ſtates alone. Therefore by the decree of the ſaide States, there were approued men of all ſortes and conditions choſen, to whome the charge and affayres of the Realme were committed: howbeit there were three of the Kings ſonnes, namely <hi>Charles, Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> of the whiche three the eldeſt was of lawfull age to gouerne. A third example he bringeth from the yeare of our Lord. M.CCCLXXV. at what time <hi>Charles</hi> the fyfth ſurnamed wiſe, appoynted by his will and teſtament <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Borbon</hi> his wiues brother, to bee the tutor and gardian of his ſonnes: and <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> his brother to be the gouernour of the Realme, vntill ſuch time as <hi>Charles</hi> hys ſonne came vnto his full and lawfull age: neuertheleſſe it was decreed by a counſayle, holden at <hi>Paris,</hi> that the will ſhould be fruſtrate, and the gouernmente of the kingdome committed to the ſayd <hi>Lewis</hi> the childes vncle, vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that in his gouernment he woulde do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aduice and conſente of other honeſt and approued perſons in the ſayde counſayle: and alſo that the wardſhip and education of the childe ſhoulde bee committed to the Duke of <hi>Borbon.</hi> A fourth example he bringeth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere of our Lorde .M.CCCXCII. at what time <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixth ſonne of the ſaid King ſodaynely fell madde, it was decreed by the authoritie of the ſtates, that the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Realme ſhould be committed to the Dukes of <hi>Berry,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Alſo he fetcheth a fifth example from the yeare. M.CCCCXXVI. when as <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Humfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> were at mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall debate to the great detriment of the common wealth: and at the length agreed betweene them ſelues, to make an end of all controuerſies by combate. In this contention the States were vmpiers, and decreed, that both of them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17727:88"/> ſhould put off their armour, and rather ende their controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by lawe, than by dinte of ſworde. Then he alleageth a ſixt example from the yeare M.CCCC.Lxxxiiij. when as <hi>Lewis</hi> the .xj. being dead, and leauing behinde him his ſonne <hi>Charles</hi> of the age of thirtene yeares, it was decreed by an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of States at <hi>Towers,</hi> that the education of the childe ſhould bee committed to <hi>Anne</hi> the kings ſiſter: and that the gouernment of the Realme ſhould bee ſet ouer to certayne choyſe and approued perſons in the ſayd aſſembly: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being the next of kinne required the ſame. He ſetteth downe alſo a ſeuenth Argument taken from that warre, which was helde in the tyme of the ſayd <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, which was of all other kings the moſt craftie and ſubtill, which alſo greatly diminiſhed the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the States, at what time the kingdom was ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by him, that in many things the duetie of a good prince and of one louing his countrey, was wanting, the authoritie of the States began to be required, that by the ſame the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth might be prouided for: and ſo by the ayde of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes and noble men warre was holden, which was therefore called, the warre of the common wealth. And vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at that tyme the authoritie of the States began to decay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which notwithſtanding <hi>Lewis</hi> fayned to haue in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation. Finally, he handeleth that queſtion. Whether the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> by the lawe of <hi>France,</hi> ought to come to the Diſtaffe: and by many reaſons and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples he ſheweth, that women ought to bee remoued from the gouernment of the Realme no leſſe than from the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſame.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And thus diſputing he offereth to the ſecret iudgementes of men by the ſtate of the auncient kingdom, an expreſſe Image of thoſe calamities, by which all things at the laſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France,</hi> are come to great diſorder and confuſion, the authoritie of the ſtates of the Realme being ouerthrowen and ſuppreſſed, and a ſtraunge woman hauing gotten into hir handes the royall gouernment.</p>

And he inuaded the territorie of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> to the great terror and feare of thoſe that dwelt in the ſame.

            <p>Againe truce was taken for a moneth and a halfe.

The conſpiracie was diſcouered. They of <hi>Rochell</hi> tooke many of the townſmen. <hi>M. Grandfiefe</hi> was ſlayne. And when enquirie was made of this conſpiracie, the conſpirators anſwered, that they had done nothing without the kings commaundement, <hi>monſ.

They of <hi>Rochell</hi> made complaint hereof to the king. The king denied the ſaid enterpriſe to be taken in hand by his commaundement: willing them to puniſh thoſe that were founde giltie of the conſpiracie, ſaying that he gaue them leaue and authoritie ſo to doe: only he willed them to beware that they did nothing contrary to the <hi>Edicte.</hi>

            <p>Therefore they of <hi>Rochell,</hi> according to their maner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution put many of the Conſpirators to death by the while: of the which many were Citizens. This was done about the the ende of the moneth of <hi>December.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>MANY</hi> of the noble men enuyed the gouernment of the Queene, (for whatſoeuer was done by king <hi>Charles</hi> was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto hir) for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe (as it is ſaid) being through effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and raſhe haſtines moued to diſpleaſure, one whyle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt ſome, another whyle agaynſt other ſome, ſought

Now, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe large promotions &amp; gifts could not but be drawen out of the kings treaſurie, that is to ſay, from the bloud of the miſerable people, lately oppreſſed with intollerable burthens of tributes, many of the noble men dayly complayned, that the common wealth was betrayed and troden vnder foote. And the foule troubles of new warres, did greatly amplify and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe complayntes: through the which warres y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citizens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mortal hatred one againſt another, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; incouraging of a ſtraunge woman, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhamefull mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes killed &amp; deſtroyed one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, to ſatiſfy the wicked appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites &amp; deſires of an vngodly <hi>Italian.</hi> Hetherto ſhe had preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of <hi>Religion:</hi> notwithſtanding ſhe ſought this one thing only by theſe ciuil diſcords, namely, That when ſhe had deſtroied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe might bring in <hi>Italians</hi> into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo ſhe might eaſely raigne alone, hauing gotten ſuch men about hir as ſtoode ſubiecte &amp; bound vnto hir.</p>
            <p>Alſo the great miſliking of the murther on Saint <hi>Barthel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewes</hi> day, made hir to be the more enuyed and deſpiſed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that might bee to that notable hatred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conceiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hir: bicauſe by the ſame fall, not only many noble hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17727:90"/> were depriued of their brethren and kinſmen, the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſorte of them of the religion being ſlayne: but alſo that the death of the noble princes and peeres was ſought, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they alwayes had imbraced the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: and that a manifeſt way was made to the vtter deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nobles of <hi>France</hi> by this enterance, and that, bicauſe this ambitious woman would leaue nothing vndone to ſhew crueltie, that ſhe might rule and gouerne after hir owne will.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the garboyle of the murthers, they which ſuſpected their bloud to be ſought, were at reſt, and were gone at the kings commaundement to the warre, to deſtroy thoſe which remayned of the Religion, who being but fewe and weake, ſeemed to be brought eaſely to deſtruction within few dayes. But when the Queenes counſailes and deuiſes tooke not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and newe murthers were made, when there was prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of warre againſt <hi>Rochell</hi> &amp; <hi>Languedoc:</hi> then men more freely began to ſpeake againſt thoſe murthers, and to deteſt thoſe ciuill warres ſtirred vp by the commaundements of the Queene, when as the contrary ſucceſſe had fruſtrated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued euen as it were in the very entry, the imagined victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning the vtter deſtruction of thoſe of the Religion. And there was none which did not greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers &amp; workers of thoſe murthers. Peace was earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and hoped for all men, when as the ſpace of two yeeres, had almoſt drowned the memory of the former troubles and iniuries, and after ſo many ſpoyles made by warres, new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie was feared, inſomuch that all men feared the cauſe of newe troubles. And the remembrance of the pretended mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age celebrated with falſehood, was moſt deteſtable, to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting reproch of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>

Yea, there was occaſion of theſe newe matters ſowen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings own lyne. The Duke of <hi>Alanco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> the kings yongeſt brother being hated of his mother, greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked his in others gouernment, and deteſted that wicked and horrible facte of the bloudy mariage. So that the Duke of <hi>Alancon</hi> ſeemed to be of their ſide. Therefore for this cauſe hee was hated of his mother. Theſe were the beginnings of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17727:91"/> great matters, the which what ſucceſſe they had we will ſhew hereafter.</p>
            <p>The countreys being wearyed with long calamities of warres, required of the king that there might be an aſſembly of the States, that extreame neceſſitie at the laſt might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a remedy for ſo great troubles. The Queene anſwered that the king &amp; ſhe did like very well of this requeſt: (for the king being dayly more and more ſicke, the Queene of hir ſelfe had the gouernment of all things) and ſhee appoynted the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of States at <hi>Compien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> helde the greateſt parte of <hi>Zealand,</hi> as we ſayd before, except <hi>Midelburge,</hi> the chiefe Citie of that countrey and <hi>Armac,</hi> the moſt famous hauen of that Citie, and of the whole Iſle.

            <p>The kings Nauy to ſuccour them of <hi>Middelburge</hi> looſed from <hi>Andwarpe</hi> the xxv. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> In this preparation, the kings Souldiers ſuſtayned great dammage and hurte. For ſodaynly a great Iron peece brake in the Ship, by the violent breach wherof thirtie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were ſlain, &amp; certain alſo which ſtood vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhore. The Ship it ſelf was by and by daſht in peeces vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flat: another ſhip after this was ouertakte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> waues. And when they came within the ſight of the towne of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the Souldiers of the Nauie to ſalute the kings Garriſon, gaue them a peale of ſhotte. By occaſion whereof fyer being vnwittingly caſt into the goonpoulder which was in one of the ſhippes, moſt horribly brent all the Souldiers that were in the ſame. For all this they went forward w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their iorney to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Middelburge.</hi> The Nauie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince of <hi>Orange</hi> encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke <hi>Reguiſence</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings Lieftena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey loking vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhoare of the towne of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> Then began a fierce battaile betwene them, both partes manfully quiting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Notwithſtanding .v. of the kings Shippes being at the firſt ouercome, the Admirall hir ſelfe alſo was conſtrayned to flee, and to forſake hir fellowes.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17727:92"/> The chiefe Captayne whoſe name was <hi>Iulian Roman,</hi> a man of great fame among the Spaniardes, ſliding out of the ſhip by a roape into a ſkiffe, forſooke the Nauie. The Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> his Nauie being conquerers, purſued the chaſe, &amp; tooke ninetene Shippes of warre. The Admirall himſelf was ſlain. All the Spaniardes, and ſpectally the olde Souldiers of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, which were taken, were caſt ouer boorde to feede fiſhes. Then the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> more vehemently vrged the ſiege of <hi>Middelburge,</hi> and ſo within fewe dayes it was brought to paſſe, that <hi>Moundragon,</hi> being without all hope of helpe, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp the Citie of <hi>Middelburge</hi> and <hi>Armac.</hi> This was the ninetene of <hi>Februarie</hi> of this yeare. The trueltie ſhewed at the ſeege of <hi>Harlem</hi> was not here recompenced. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> rather conquered with lenitie and gentlenes, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, he graunted lyfe alſo to the morrow maſſe Prieſtes: but the Captaines &amp; Centurions he ſent priſoners to <hi>Eliſhing,</hi> hauing giuen leaue to <hi>Mountdragon</hi> their chief Captaine to redeeme them, for the which cauſe he, leauing behynde him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith, and twelue hoſtages, went to <hi>Andwerpe,</hi> that he might make exchaunge of Captiues. This <hi>Mountdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> ſo highly commended the humanitie, clemencie, &amp; fayth of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> vnto the kings Lefetenant <hi>Regniſence,</hi> that he brought himſelfe in ſuſpicion with him, and alſo into great perill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ABOVT</hi> this tyme <hi>Mongon</hi> an experte Captaine, in the fyrſt ciuill warres of great name &amp; fame for killing of <hi>Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecondrin,</hi> tooke certayne ſmall townes in the countrey of <hi>Velay,</hi> and certayne ſtrong Caſtelles: and he was now appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the Citie of <hi>Puij,</hi> which was full of riche Marthants: hauing already taken the Caſtell <hi>Eſpaule;</hi> which was within ſee ſight of the Citie, by the ſubtill practiſe of <hi>Guiard</hi> of <hi>Puij,</hi> a man of no religion and yet pretending to be of the religion. Now the ſpoyling Souldier being made rich with the praye, bought of the Souldiers of the Caſtell of <hi>Eſpaule,</hi> one of the Captaynes being corrupted with money by the men of <hi>Puij,</hi> both the head of <hi>monſ.

               <hi>M. Mongon</hi> himſelfe on the other parte, was by treaſon ſlaine.

            <p>There ſtandeth vppon the bancke of the Riuer of Roſne a Caſtell called <hi>Perand.</hi> This Caſtell did the Lord of the ſame (who from the tyme of the ſlaughter at <hi>Paris</hi> fayned the abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Religion) take, &amp; a little towne alſo called <hi>Andace,</hi> fortifying the ſayd Caſtell with a Garriſon of Souldiers of the Religion.

               <hi>CONCERNING</hi> the aſſembly of ſtates appoynted to be holden by the Queene, we haue ſpoken before. The aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner of <hi>France</hi> is, that before the generall aſſembly of States, the perticular aſſemblies of the ſtates of euery prouince Aſſie together, that by deliberation they might determine, what ſhould be handled in the generall aſſembly.

The ſame authoritie ſhe gaue alſo to them of the Religion, for whoſe affayres ſpecial prouiſion ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be made. Notwithſtanding hee to whom this charge was committed, was taken at <hi>Lions,</hi> by the Lifetenant <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot,</hi> and was kept in warde certayne monethes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Queene was much troubled in mynde, and very carefull for the auoyding of diuers dangerous ſtraytes. For ſhe did perceiue that they of the religion were not only ſproong vp in great number, but alſo that they were more wyſe, and by the late ſucceſſe alſo of matters, more conſtant and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17727:93"/> and that therefore ſhee ſhould haue a ſore conflict with them. To theſe were added new enemies, who hauing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to religion, but only a care of ciuil affayres, would haue the gouernment reformed and in better ſtate. And ſhe was not ignorant how that the moſt famous of the nobles, were both authors and alſo inſtruments of that counſaile. Shee knew that hir ſonne the Duke of <hi>Alancon</hi> was an enemy vnto hir gouernment: furthermore, that the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were very angry with the perill and dammage which they had receyued in their owne perſons: therefore the ambicious woman ſuſpected that they alſo were of this counſaile, to remoue hir from the gouernment of the Realme. The Kings health bring paſt all hope of recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the neere approachyng of his death, was giuen out by his ſoothſayers (whoſe helpe and counſaile the Queene greatly vſed) which cauſed hir to feare leaſt according to the cuſtome of the lawes and ordinances of the Realme the gouernement of the ſame ſhould bee ſet ouer vnto the Duke of <hi>Alancon:</hi> whereby the counſailes and deuiſes of hir e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes, had an open way made for them to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte.</p>
            <p>To take away theſe inconueniences, the woman by long experience of matters and by gouernement in great affayres being more circumſpect and ſubtil than the wiſeſt, purpoſed to prouide all meanes and wayes. She ioyned pollicie and force together, that ſhe might not faile to bring hir purpoſe to paſſe. She pretended the kings name in all cauſes &amp; in euery place, whom notwithſtanding ſhee made very ſeldome priuy to hir counſailes, bicauſe he was ſicke, as ſhe pretended. She ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully prouided, that the kings armies ſhould bee in a readines at hir commaundement, vnder the colour of warre againſt <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the which was certainly ſayde to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, excepte they of the Religion in <hi>Languedoc</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue theſe conditions commaunded in the <hi>Edicte</hi> of <hi>Rochell:</hi> And the Countie <hi>D'Retes</hi> hauing receiued a great ſumme of money, gathered ſouldiers together in <hi>Germany.</hi> Alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17727:93"/> hir policies was, that the authors of the new ſturres ſhould be deſtroyed by a new murther. Aboue the reſt <hi>d'Anuil</hi> withſtood theſe miſcheuous deuiſes, who being far from the Courte, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med plainly to make delay, notwithſtanding that he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes commaunded in the kings name to come: at what tyme he being in a great and large countrey moſt fitte &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for his purpoſe by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of them of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeemed to be in poſſibilitie to enioy both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings armie, and alſo the noble cities therin, he beheld dayly other enemies, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the queene ſawe to be leſſe appliant to do iniurie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there came oftentimes letters of the king to <hi>d'Anuil:</hi> that eyther ſetting all excuſe aſyde &amp; leauing the prouince in peace he would come vnto the king, or els veryly that he ſhould be apprehended amidſt theſe communications of peace. And for this purpoſe <hi>M. Sanſulpis,</hi> and <hi>M. Villeroy</hi> were ſent to <hi>d'Anuil</hi> vnder the colour of peace, ſpeciall commaundements of the Queene concerning this matter being giuen to <hi>M. Suz</hi> and <hi>Mongeron,</hi> who in thoſe partes were of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie among the Catholiques.</p>
            <p>On the other parte the Queenes enemyes had their ſecret counſailes, the ende whereof was, that an aſſembly of States might bee had euen by meere commaundement, and that the gouernement of the Realme might be reſtored to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate: concerning the which matter what we know, wee wil ſpeake anon. Therfore while the Queene ſent often meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers into <hi>Languedoc</hi> concerning peace, both <hi>d'Anuill</hi> was diligent in his affayres, and alſo they of the Religion wiſhed peace.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe they of the religion made new delayes dayly by thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of peace (which they called a collation) and meſſengers were ſent to and fro from the Courte into <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Theſe things thus continued from <hi>Ianuary</hi> vnto the moneth of <hi>March.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>ABOVT</hi> the ſame tyme, the Catholiques thought that

            <p>About the beginning of <hi>Februarie,</hi> there brake forth newe bandes of newe men in the countrey of <hi>Poictou,</hi> which called themſelues <hi>Politikes</hi> and <hi>Malecontentes:</hi> of the which ſome profeſſed that they ſought the reformation of the realme: other ſome the reuenge of their parentes and kinſmen which were ſlayne in the furies on Saint <hi>Barthelmewes</hi> day. Theſe ioyned themſelues with thoſe of the Religion: who almoſt about the ſame tyme had begoon warre a freſhe in the conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Poictou,</hi> hauyng <hi>Monſieur L'Noe</hi> theyr Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17727:95"/> 
               <hi>Sanlo,</hi> and <hi>Charent,</hi> townes neere vnto the Sea coaſt: and in <hi>Normandy</hi> the lower he tooke the towne called <hi>Donfro.</hi> Therefore theſe newe commotions of the <hi>Politikes</hi> and of the Religious cauſed newe muſters of men in thoſe partes, and it was ſayde that this was the beginning of great matters, and that many noble men would come vnto this warre. But whereunto this came we will ſhewe by and by.</p>
            <p>Almoſt at the ſame tyme, namely the laſt of <hi>February,</hi> there was great feare in the Courte. It was tolde the Queene that there was certayne troupes of horſemen ſeene ryding to and fro neere vnto <hi>Sangerman,</hi> where the king at that tyme lay. This ſo ſodayne feare cauſed the number to bee thought the greater. <hi>M. d'Guitri</hi> a noble man, was Captayn ouer thoſe troupes, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned fiue hundred horſemen. The Queene tolde the king hereof, being at the poynt of death, and cauſed him to bee remoued out of hande from <hi>Sangerman</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> And ſhee ſent meſſengers vnto <hi>M. d'Guitri,</hi> to know of hym in the kings name, what his entent was. Who deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meſſengers certayne petitions concerning the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Realme, and the reſtoring of the authoritie of the ſtates: and ſo within fewe dayes after, departed, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what would enſue thereof. In the meane tyme the Queene apprehended many in the Courte, and in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Paris,</hi> whom ſhee thought to bee giltie of this conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie: among which, of the nobilitie was <hi>M. Coconaſs,</hi> and <hi>d'Mole</hi> of <hi>Arles,</hi> one of the familiar frendes of the Duke of <hi>Alanſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo, at the ſame tyme the Marſhalles <hi>Momorencie</hi> and <hi>Coſse</hi> were in the Courte. They within certayne dayes after, were at the commaundement of the king and Queene appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the Kings Garde, and were openly in the ſight of all men, caryed into the Caſtell of <hi>Baſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queene alſo cauſed Rumors to be ſpred abroad, that they were the authors of a bolde conſpiracie, concernyng the intercepting of the King, and the ſettyng ouer of the kyngdome to the Duke of <hi>Alancon,</hi> to the ende they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17727:96"/> might rule all things as they themſelues luſted. Therefore ſhe commaunding the houſehold ſeruants of the king of <hi>Nauar,</hi> and of hir ſonne the Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> to be taken away, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be kept cloſe priſoners, that they might go no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor do any thing without keepers. She depriued <hi>D'Anuil</hi> alſo of the gouernment of <hi>Languedoc</hi> as acceſſarie to the ſayd conſpiracie: and ſhe ſent the Prince <hi>d'Alphine</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Monpenſer</hi> into <hi>Daulphine</hi> with great power to bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and ſhe wrote vnto the Senat of <hi>Tholoſe</hi> concerning the ſame depriuation of <hi>d'Anuill.</hi> Alſo ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Lord <hi>d'Acier</hi> by hir letters, who was an enemy to <hi>d'Anuill,</hi> to ayde <hi>d'Alphine</hi> in the cuſtody of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> &amp; to bring vnto him all the power hee was able to make. All theſe things were done in the kings name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mombrune,</hi> about the very comming of the Prince <hi>D'Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> ſlew fiue Enſignes of footemen at a towne called <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane tyme <hi>D'Anuill</hi> lay ſtill, doing all things in the kings name: neyther did he enterpriſe any thing any whit the more when he vnderſtood of the impriſonment of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the kings letters which Prince <hi>d'Aulphine</hi> ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lord <hi>d'Acier,</hi> were intercepted at <hi>Puſin,</hi> and came to his handes, and by that hee perceyued the treaſon wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: then began he more openly to deale with them of the religion, and to talke alſo with <hi>monſ. Sanroman,</hi> &amp; to take certayne cities: but ſomewhat to late. For he loſt the more noble cities by his long delay. But he tooke <hi>Mountpellier, Boucar, Lunell,</hi> and <hi>Pozenac</hi> and from <hi>Pozenac</hi> he was repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the treaſon of a certaine Captayne, to whom hee had committed both the Citie and alſo his daughter which was but two yeeres olde.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Two noble men beheaded</note>At the laſt, by the kings commaundement, <hi>M. Coconaſs,</hi> and <hi>d'Mole</hi> were arayned in the Senat of <hi>Paris,</hi> and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of high treaſon againſt the kings perſon &amp; the ſtate: for which they were put to death, and their goods confiſcate to the King Rumors were ſpred abroad that the <hi>Momorencies</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:17727:96"/> and Marſhall Coſſe, were the chiefe authors of their conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: and yet notwithſtanding it is euidently knowen, that neither <hi>Cononas</hi> nor <hi>d'Mole,</hi> nor any of thoſe which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, had committed any ſuch thing. Men ſayd that the Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> ſought to flee vnto <hi>Lodowic Naſsau,</hi> bicauſe he knew that treaſon was practiſed againſt him. The Senate doubted to condemne them for this cauſe: for that the houſe of <hi>Naſsau</hi> were called by the king in his <hi>Edicte,</hi> his frendes. But to the ende the treaſon might appere by the confeſſion of thoſe that were apprehended, the king pronounced <hi>Lodowic Naſsau</hi> to be his enimy. And ſo the Senate gaue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt them. Amidſt theſe domeſticall confuſions of the courte, all things were ordered either by blinde treaſon, or els by mad violence. Wyſe men blamed much the lingering delay of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marſhals, who deferring the tyme, loſte all occaſions to bring any thing well to paſſe: and ſo behaued themſelues, that they ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much as to haue thoſe matters in their thought. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was certainly reported, that a great number of the nobilitie of <hi>France,</hi> abhorring long ago the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Queene, and of ſtraungers, bicauſe they were not only reiected, but were alſo in daunger of their lyfe to fill vp thoſe furies on Saint <hi>Barthelmewes</hi> day, had determined to reuyue againe the authoritie of the States, and to reforme all things according to the preſcript of the auncient lawes of the Realme. To this alſo there was added a newe cauſe, namely the diſpayred health of the King. Therefore he being dead, it was ſayd, that their purpoſe was to giue the gouernement of the Realme vnto the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> in the abſence of his brother, which was next heire vnto the Crowne. It was alſo neceſſarie for the peace and tranquilitie of the Realme, that Religion ſhould be prouided for. We will in another place ſet downe the forme of that proteſtation, in the which <hi>d'Anuill</hi> declareth the cauſes why he armed him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Treaſon alſo was practiſed againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> Who at that tyme was at <hi>Amiens,</hi> the chiefe citie of <hi>Picardie.</hi> And hauing intelligence of the treaſon, went out of <hi>Amiens</hi> a

            <p>Within few dayes after, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Nauar</hi> publiſhed a bil, by which he clered himſelf from all ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracie againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king.

So ſoone as <hi>Mongome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> ſawe that the ſame was beſeeged, after deliberation had, he went out of the towne with a hundred and threeſcore horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (for he had not two hundred in all) and came to <hi>Danfro,</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:17727:97"/> which, as we ſayd before, he had taken. <hi>Danfro</hi> is a little town of the lower <hi>Normandy,</hi> in the territorie of <hi>Paſsi</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alanſons</hi> dominion, which towne was hitherto obſcure, and now by the calamitie of <hi>Mongomerie</hi> made famous, beyng walled rounde about with a weake wal, yet notwithſtanding fortified with a ſtrong Caſtell: all along the ſame ran the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Meiſne.

So ſoone as <hi>Monſ. Matigon</hi> heard hereof, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Mongomerie</hi> was within the walles of <hi>Donfro,</hi> he came without delay to <hi>Donfro,</hi> leauing parte of his armie at the ſeege of <hi>Sanlo:</hi> and with the ſounde of Trumpets gathered together from all partes a great number of thoſe countrey men, and ſent vnto the King for more ayde. There came therefore vnto him of the Kings Souldiers from all places: the citie was beſeeged, and the walles ſodenly battered with great guns. <hi>Mongomerie</hi> at the firſt ſought to deliuer him ſelfe out of the towne: the which when he could not doe, hee lefte the Citie, and tooke the Caſtell. He had with him ſcarce a hundred and fyftie Souldiers: who being out of hope, ſought all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, eyther by colour of eruption, or by parley to flee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enemie. The Caſtell was battered with ordinance. The fyrſt charge <hi>Mongomerie</hi> valiantly withſtoode, to the great hurte of his enimies: but when he ſawe that his men fell away from him, and that hee wanted things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the defence of hym ſelfe and the Caſtell, hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to parley with <hi>M.

And thus hee yelded vp the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and hym ſelfe to <hi>M. Matigon.</hi> Then the Kynges Souldiers runnyng through the breaches of the walles
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17727:98"/> into the Caſtell, ſlue whomſoeuer they met contrary to their fayth and promiſe. And <hi>Mongomeri</hi> was by and by brought vnto the King. But what was decreed concerning him, wee will ſhewe hereafter. And within fewe dayes <hi>Saulo</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> were yelded vp to the King. This was the ſucceſſe of <hi>Mongomeries</hi> warre. He was taken the xxvij. day of <hi>May</hi> of this yeere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> King was ſicke dayly more and more.

Tyme ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and bewray euery circumſtance. Moſt certayn it is, that he was ſicke of a bloudy flixe. And it is reported for truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greater parte, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud iſſued from diuers partes of his body, that in his bed hee tumbled and toſſed and could take little reſt, horribly curſing and blaſpheming the name of God, which he had vſed to doe euen from his childehood, and that in great fume and anger hee called and repeated often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes the name of the <hi>Momorencies.</hi> And bicauſe it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently ſuſpected that he was poyſoned, to make him with more eaſe to vomit (men ſay) that hee was bolſtered vp with pillowes that his feete might lye hyer than his head, whereby he caſt out ſuch abundant ſtore of bloud, that hee dyed within fewe houres after: And he did nothing but blaſpheme vntill the laſt gaſpe.

Then comming into the market place, &amp; placing watche and ward in diuers places, made a great crye for payment of their money: threatning the general ſpoyle of the Citie if they were not ſatiſfied out of hande. Concerning the which matter, while the Citizens of <hi>Andwerpe</hi> conſulted with the Kings deputie, the Spaniardes in the meane tyme by the ſpace of two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes ſpoyled and tooke their pleaſure of the Citie in moſte ſhamefull manner. The Duke <hi>Reguizens</hi> the Kings deputie, fayning that he was greatly diſpleaſed with this ſedition of the Spaniardes, (for there are ſome which beleue that he was the author and cauſe of all that tumult, bicauſe the ſtates of the low countrey had before that tyme refuſed to pay that money which he often tymes required of them) hauing at the laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned of the Spaniards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſumme of CCCC.M.

            <p>This is that (O moſt ſoueraigne King) which your ſayd ſubiectes do, and haue not without occaſion eſteemed to be the greateſt calamitie that might happen vnto them, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And therfore although they had reſolued &amp; taken in hand with patience to attende the time of redreſſe, thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your Maieſtie would at laſt haue opened your eares and eyes to heare and ſee their miſerable eſtate, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which your Maieſty by reaſon of their ſaid euil willers is now letted.

            <p>And firſt wee humbly beſeeche your Maieſtie to call to
<pb facs="tcp:17727:102"/> minde and conſider, that theſe your countries in times paſt hauing bin deuided amongſt ſundry Lordes and rulers, are ſince by mariages, agreementes, and mutual treaties, in time, and orderly by lawfull ſucceſſion and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences come vnder the houſe of <hi>Burgondie,</hi> and afterwardes, by meanes of mariages contracted with the moſt famous houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> and conſequently allied with the moſte mightie kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet alwayes with expreſſe condition, that euery and ſingular the countries and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces ſhould poſſeſſe and enioy their owne policies, rights and liberties in tymes paſte accuſtomed, without that any prouince or countrey ſhould be burdened of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the other, or by any meanes be depriued of their cuſtomes or liberties, but be bound ioyntly to lyue one with another vnder one Prince and head, as many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnder one father, to the intent with one accorde to defende their Prince and common weale againſt al ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and forraine force.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Princes of the countrey willing as fathers to ſhewe and declare their loue and affection to euery one, did at their ſolemnizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and entring into their dominion and rule, by a ſolempne othe bynde themſelues to vſe and kepe eche country in their rightes and franchiſes, without ſuffering that any of them ſhould be enfringed or demini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one Prouince ſhold haue dominion or rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the other, much leſſe be ſubiect vnto any foraine domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or power: vppon which conditions he is accepted and taken as a ſupreme Lord and Gouernour ouer the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and thereuppon receyueth the othe of obedience and faithfulneſſe of his ſubiectes.</p>
            <p>Of which the premiſes needeth not any further or larger reherſal, whileſt that vndoubtedly your maieſtie doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently remembre, howe that the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> of moſt noble memorie, following the preſidentes of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, and acknowledging that the ſayde othe of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization
<pb facs="tcp:17727:102"/> is the onely and right fundation, vpon which doth conſiſt aſwel the might and authoritie of a Prince, as the faith and obedience of his ſubiectes, did in his life time, &amp; preſence of your maieſtie, cauſe your Maieſtie to receiue the ſayde countries vnder the ſayde othe, and ſware your Maieſtie to the ioyful income in al the landes &amp; moſt of the townes, as next ſucceſſour and onely heire of his emperiall maieſtie: and afterwardes the ſame Emperal maieſtie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of theſe countries, and your Maieſty receiuing the full dominion, and adminiſtration of the Lande, did once againe, in preſence of the deputied of the countries then aſſembled, rehearſe &amp; ſtrongly confirme the ſaide pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges. So that in al times paſt the ſayde countries haue enioyed &amp; bin ruled by their former priuileges &amp; liberties.</p>
            <p>Out of which hath followed ſuch faithfulneſſe and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſubiectes towards their Prince, and ſuch vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and loue amongeſt eche other, that the countries by god his prouidence, haue floriſhed with moſt happie proſperitie, the Princes then adorned with all honour and high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and greatly redoubted and feared of their enimies.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it needes not to rehearſe any thing out of the olde hiſtories, being notwithſtanding expleniſhed with many preſidents, it hath appeared in all the warres of the Emperiall maieſtye, what earneſt care hee had to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and mayntenaunce of his countries in reſt and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe your Maieſty can wel remember, that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leaue of theſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, did ſpecially and earneſtly recommend the ſtate thereof vnto your maieſtye: Yea your maieſtie being at his arriuall burdened with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous warres and extreeme charges, hath by experience founde that all your ſubiectes both great and ſmal, euerye one to his ſtate &amp; abilitie, haue bin readie to venture bothe life and goods in ſeruice of your Maieſtie. Wherein aſwell the Lords and nobles, as commons, haue ſo acquited and
<pb facs="tcp:17727:103"/> behaued themſelues, that your maieſtie hath vanquiſhed and ouercome your enimies, gotten great prayſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of al kings and potentates, and made a finall end of al warres &amp; diſſentions, wherwith many yeares before your auncetors and countries were troubled.</p>
            <p>Now if it might pleaſe your Maieſtie, (which your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and faithful ſubiectes do moſt humbly require) to enquire of and conſider the original occaſions of the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch &amp; good quiet proſperitie, into ſuch miſerable commotions and extremities, wherwith the countries are now ſuppreſſed: your maieſtie ſhall find them to ſpring out of the malice and enuie whiche ſome (being about your Maieſtie) do beare to the proſperitie and welfare wherwith God almightie hath bleſſed your countries and ſubiectes.</p>
            <p>Which enuie and cancred malice, being further incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; ſtuffed with vnſatiable auarice &amp; vnmeaſurable prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie, hath brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch crueltie and tirannie, that they altogether forgetting al affection &amp; ſeruice which they did owe vnto the countrey wherein they haue gotten great honour &amp; benefites, haue (to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great preiudice of the ſeruice of your Maieſtie and common wealth of theſe countries) prooured by all meanes and practiſes this moſt haynous fyre of commotion, to thintent to aſpire to the dignity ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the ſtates of the lande, yea of your maieſtie.</p>
            <p>And knowyng wel that to compaſſe that deuiſe, it was a matter impoſſible, the cuſtomes and liberties of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes remayning in force, which do altogether contrarye their wicked pretence: conſidering beſides, howe diligent and faithfull they of the ſaide countries were euery one in his vocation (according to their othe) to ſtand to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of the ſame: they attempted in peruerſe manner to interprete to your Maieſtie the doings and procedings of the Lordes, gouernours, and ſtates of the land, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mayntenaunce of the ſayd rightes, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in ſuche ſorte as if they tended to diſobedience or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb facs="tcp:17727:103"/> towardes your Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>Amongſt which, ſpecially ſome being ſpirituall perſons, haue by all meanes attempted and ſought, vnder pretence and ſhadowe of religion to confederate wyth other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine prelates, and ſo by ſecret attempts and practiſes, to bring the countrie in hatred of your Maieſtie, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they with their confederates which are by oth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed not with your Maieſtie, but with ſtraunge rulers and countries in <hi>Italie,</hi> and elſe where, ſpecially with the Pope of <hi>Roome,</hi> might here beare rule and gouernaunce, &amp;c. and as poſſibilitie and commoditie ſerued, to enlarge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame.</p>
            <p>For when they firſt, perceiued that in all the countries here abouts yea ouer all Chriſtendome, their rude and manifeſt abuſes, and errours, by reaſon of the negligence and auarice of the prieſtes were diſcribed, and ſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it began to greeue the chiefe &amp; notableſt perſons, that they which ought onely to meddle with inſtructing of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the faith and feare of God, and to execute his ſeruice with all fidelitie, according to the example of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Apoſtles, did in ſteade therof, not onely contrarye to God his commaundement, but alſo to the decrees of the former Popes, and to al ordinances of the old counſels, yea againſt all ſtatutes and vſages of Princes and countries take vppon them to deale in worldly and Ciuil pollicies: yea alſo in matters touching warfare and rule of countries, ſeeking to ſuppreſſe all degrees, and to reſerue the generall gouernement too themſelues, taking in hande too bring all eſtates in diſdaine and hatred of the Princes, aſwell the ſubiects of your Maieſtie, as of diuers other kinges and Potentates, accuſing them ſlaunderouſly with ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rebellion: whereby they haue ſtyrred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked in all cuntries, troubles, and diſſention, warres and bloudſhed, ſetting the ſubiectes at diſcorde with their
<pb facs="tcp:17727:104"/> rulers, and the rulers againſt the ſubiectes, and generally turned all things vpſide downe, and brought in execrable confuſion &amp; errour, not eſteeming who was endamaged, ſo as they might atchieue the accompliſhment of their rule and dominion, and bring all things vnder their rule and aucthoritie.</p>
            <p>And to that intent, haue they ſought, to plant in this countrey the inquiſition, deuiſed and inuented in <hi>Spaine,</hi> by certaine <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Renegados,</hi> by that meanes to breake all priuileges, rightes, and auncient cuſtomes, and to make fruſtrate all ſworne contracts, vſages, and counſelles, and ſo to get a full power and dominion ouer all your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties faithfull ſeruants, which ſtand to the othe whiche they haue made to your Maieſtie, not acknowledging any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Lords, ſpiritual or temporal, which might ſeeke by falſe accuſations to impute vnto your ſubiectes, hereſie &amp; rebellion, to the intent thereby to attaine to their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For better accompliſhing whereof haue they by force vrged and brought in the newe Biſhops, contrary to all landrights, and ſworne priuileges, to the empairing of your Maieſties aucthoritie: choſing them not for vertue, prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or learning (being moſt of them, of the moſt rude and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedſt ſort) but onely for that they take them, as faithful and true aſſiſtentes, in the executing of their tiranny and crueltie.</p>
            <p>Their ſaide vngodly enterpriſes and conſequences of the ſame being the longer the more eſpied, haue the moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Lords, Gouernours, and Gentlemen, with the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and countrey, giuen intelligence &amp; knowledge to your Maieſtie by continuall ſupplications, remonſtrances and other poſſible meanes, howe much the aucthoritie of your Maieſtie ſhould be empaired, ſhortened and deminiſhed, by the ſaid Inquiſitors and Biſhops, being moſt of them ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and outlanders, by othe bound vnto foraine Princes, and (as they pretende) exempt of your iuriſdiction, and
<pb facs="tcp:17727:104"/> by the ſame haue alleged the euident impoſſibilitie to bring in ſuch innouations, and nouelties, but that it would tend to the vtter ruine and deſtruction of the whole countrie: ſeing that it was moſt apparant that the bringing in therof was but a borowed cloake to ſhadow their doings, in abuſing of your Maieſtie, and ſuppreſſing of ſuche as would controle their wicked and moſte notorious procedings and abuſes, whiche they themſelues can ſcarce conceale. Of which the number in theſe countries is ſo greate and manifolde, and dayly doth yet more encreaſe: that if your Maieſtie would haue bin ruled by their perſuaſions and counſel in executing of rigour and extremities, they would haue made your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie a king without ſubiects, and your ſubiects without rulers, as is moſt notorious by the innumerable number of thoſe, which in theſe countries haue vnder pretence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion bene executed and murthered, aſwell with fyre and water as with the ſword: beſides an infinite multitude whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are fled out of the countrie, bearing with them all occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations and notable ſciences to the inſtructing of others, &amp; vnſpeakeable preiudice of your Maieſtie and countries.</p>
            <p>Whereupon your Maieſtie was in the ende occaſioned to a myld moderation of the placardes, by the ſame decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that your meaning was not to bring in the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which likewiſe was by the Ducheſſe of <hi>Perma,</hi> and the Lordes and Gouernours of the countrie in the behalfe of your Maieſtie, ſolemnly promiſed to all the Townes and ſubiects, and accordingly publiſhed by open proclamations, by commaundement of the Magiſtrates. But ſhortly after, all that was ouer turned by meanes of the aforſaide per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who in deed ſeeme to haue firmely perſwaded your maieſtie, that ſuch was to the diminiſhing of your maieſties reputation and dignitie, vniuſtly alleadging, that your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects woulde withdrawe them ſelues from the duetifull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of your maieſtie. So that it is euident that your maieſtie vpon their informations, was moued to ſende the
<pb facs="tcp:17727:105"/> Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into theſe countries, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with armes and force to compel your Maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, to that whiche they of them ſelues haue with al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and obedience at all times offered.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding that the aforeſaide Lordes and Townes of theſe countries had good occaſion to thinke that they ſhoulde be greatly wronged through force of foraine ſouldiours, and rule of a ſtraunge Gouernour, not being of their Countrie, nor of your Maieſties kinred or deſcent, but ſuch a one as did beare towardes them a moſt cancred hatred, had meanes ſufficient to preuent his comming into the countrey: yet becauſe hee came in the name of your Maieſtie, and to make euident that they had not rebelled or declined from the obedience of your Maieſtie, truſting to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience and right, haue willingly and honorably receiued him with all ſuche as it pleaſed your Maieſtie to ſende with him, opening to him the gates of the Townes, deliuered into his handes the fortreſſes and ſtrong holdes, and entertayned garriſons, onely for that he declared, that ſuch was the will and pleaſure of your Maieſtie to be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by aſſured of the fidelitie and obedience of your ſubiectes, which were accuſed to your Maieſtie as rebels and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. Therefore, reaſon would haue required, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> ſhould by al meanes and diligence haue informed your Maieſtie of ſuch your ſubiects true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and inclination: and before hee had proceeded to the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of rigour, taken good &amp; ful information of their complaintes: and chiefly touching the bringing in of theſe newe Biſhops and Inquiſitors, contrarying God and all rightes, and that vppon good and true report therof made to your Maieſtie, redreſſe and remedie might haue bene had.</p>
            <p>But nowe cleane contrarywiſe, ſo ſoone as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued and was in poſſeſſion of the force and rule of the Countrey, hath without keping of any order of Iuſtice, or
<pb facs="tcp:17727:105"/> hauing regarde to the landrightes and priuileges wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Maieſtie is ſworne: not onely put to death and chaſed away the moſt part of the Lords and gouernours of theſe countries, by your Maieſtie elected and placed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo generally declared all the priuileges and liberties to bee forfaited, and the Countrie to be vſed as a countrie newly conqueſted by force of armes, to the vſe of him and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, and ſo conſequently freely to deale with the liues and goods of your ſubiectes, as their luſtes and appetites ſhall require.</p>
            <p>And if poſſibly might be layde before your Maieſties eyes the exceſſiue force and not heard off cruelties which here haue bin vſed ſince the beginning of his gouernement, by ſpoyling, robbing, chaſing away, and deſolating: by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, taking, baniſhment, and confiſcating of goods, yea by burning, hanging, heading, hacking, racking, &amp; moſt horrible and not before heard off tormentes and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Subiects of your Maieſtie, aſwell Noble as innoble, poore as rich, yong as old, widowes and orphanes, men, women, and yong maidens, of what ſtate, qualitie, or condition ſoeuer they were: we doubt not but that your Maieſtie would be amazed to heare the rehearſall thereof: yea and woulde be greeued at the ſame, that vnder your name ſuch vnnaturall crueltie and tyrannie ſhould be vſed as neither <hi>Phalaris, Nero, Pharao, Herode,</hi> or any other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Tyrant could haue inuented the like, as now is vſed towardes your faithfull ſubiects, which with their liues &amp; goods haue alwayes laboured to keepe the Crown on your Maieſties head, againſt al your enimies.</p>
            <p>And that your Maieſtie would alſo haue taken remorſe of ſo many innocent infants chaſed away out of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Country into ſtraunge lands: ſo many poore widowes and orphanes, and alſo vppon the lamentable cry of the whole Countrie whiche nowe are ſuppreſſed by this moſte horrible tirant.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:17727:106"/>
            <p>For there is none whiche could defende or preſerue his goods from their auarice, their wiues or daughters from their filthy luſtes, or their liues from their bloudthirſtineſſe. Nobilitie, Riches, manhood, or good ſeruice done in times paſt, coulde nothing preuaile, if once he was entred into hatred of them. And without taking regard to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſdictions or ordinarie courſes of the countrie, hath ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Iuriſdictions of all Iuſtices, either in ciuil or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal cauſes which in any wiſe concerne the confiſcations pronounced in his bloudy Counſel, in ſuch ſorte as neither ſpirituall or temporall perſones, widowes or orphanes, hoſpitals, Spittels, Lazarous houſes, or other whiche had good and deuable reuenues, amongſt that confiſcated goods, coulde get any payment or ſatiſfaction. But the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> hath gotten all into his hands, without any minde to diſcharge any the premiſſes, notwithſtanding the diuers and earneſt ſolicitations and requeſtes to him made in that behalfe by the ſtates of the Countries, delaying the poore agreeued ſubiectes with dilatorie and vnfounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtillations, the one alwayes contrarying the other, and without ſending ouer the matters to the prouincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or ordinary Iuſtices, to the intent to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſpaire of any ſatiſfaction to be made by the courte, where by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they haue bin ſummoned to their exceſſiue charge, and vppon ſummes of ſmall value haue bene forced to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter charges than the principall hath amounted vnto, not ſuffering any lawful tranſport to be made of any one debte for the other. To conſider what number of honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and yong maydens they haue with force and violence rauiſhed, and that the one after the other: yea miſuſed ſome euen to the death. Howe often haue they compelled the huſband to remaine with the wife, and the father with the daughter, to force them with their eyes to beholde their moſt vilanous filthineſſe, and made them as inſtrumentes to the accompliſhing of their luxurious luſte, vſing ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:17727:106"/> vnnatural and beaſtly faſhions, that wee are in a manner abaſhed and aſtonied to declare the ſame to your Maieſty. Howe often hath it happened, that the huſbande ſeeking to defende his wife or daughter of their rauiſhment, that they haue altogither as furious curres, run out of the houſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither crying <hi>Spania, Spania,</hi> murthering a number of the poore commons. How m ny women gret with childe haue they ript vp the bellies of, and murthered the fruite in their wombes.</p>
            <p>Haue they not fleyed and pulled off the ſkinne of ſome men being aliue, and headded their drummes with the ſame ſkin? others haue they not toſted with ſmal fires, nipped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with red burning tongs euen to the death, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murthered a number, and made them dye a hundreth deathes? How many women haue they chaſed from their huſbands, and children from their parentes: yea what is there vnder the heauens ſo honeſt or holy which they haue not defiled and troden vnder foote? Verily amongeſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, yea amongſt the cruelleſt. the burying of the dead, hath alwayes bin permitted and reuerenced.</p>
            <p>But this Tirant in the deſpyte of God and nature, is ſo obſtinate and peruerſe, that hee hath cauſed to be taken out of the graue the carcaſſes of the dead, and conueied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gallowes, vnder pretence that ſome of them dying without ſhrifte, &amp; others without houſeling, had forfaited their goods, which he tooke as confiſcated. What is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men more holy and honeſt, than is the ſtate of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie being the only and true foundation of all mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al loue &amp; frendſhip, the original of the loue, bond of peace, &amp; the direct way of al dealings amongſt men: wherof this Tyrant maketh ſo little accompte, that hee ſeuereth the men from their wiues, and the wiues from their huſbands, being ioyned togither in the congregation before God and his Angels, cleane contrary to the commaundement and inſtitution of almightie God, and rightes, &amp; al vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb facs="tcp:17727:107"/> that they were ioyned togither in the way of hereſie: but to ſay truth, it is onely in ſpoyling manner, to matche the beautifull and riche Matrons with his Souldiers and ruffians, and finally by his crueltie burſt in ſunder the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall bande tending to the intertayning of all mutuall loue: murthering and killing the women which in time of extremitie had releeued their huſbands, and the children for ſuccoring the neceſſitie of their parents, yea thoſe which had only with a letter comforted any of them. And to the ende that nothing ſhould by him be left vndefiled, hath he troden in moſt deſpitefull manner vnder foote the moſt holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme, whereby we are incorporated in the body of Ieſus Chriſt and communion of God his Church, willing and commaunding that thoſe children which were Chriſtened openly and lawfully according to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieſus Chriſt, in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, ſhould once agayne be baptiſed, vnder pretence that they were Chriſtened as Heretiques, and repugnant contrary to all godly and naturall rightes, ordinances of the Church, and decrees of Councels.</p>
            <p>Furthermore it needeth not to rehearſe to your Maieſty, the greeuous exactions inuented by him, one after another, and without meaſure doth vrge of the poore commons, as the hundrethes, twenties, yea the tenth penie, of all goodes, mouables and immouables, of all goodes bought and ſolde, demaunding, yea and vrging by execution contrary to the aduice and counſell of all eſtates in theſe countries, not of the cleare gaines of the ſame, but the tenth, and twentie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the capitall ſumme of all ſales. Whereby not only all trades and trafficques, are abandoned out of the land, but likewiſe the ſubiects of the ſame, depriued from the getting of the liuing, of them, their wiues, and children. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the ſtates, haue at ſundry times done their endeuour largely to infourme the ſaid Duke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences which might follow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid demaund:
<pb facs="tcp:17727:107"/> and requeſted that he would in their behalfe aduertiſe your Maieſtie thereof: woulde not hearken to them but ſhaked them off without any comfort: although he was by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the counſell and eſtates of the lande therevnto moſt earneſtly inſtanced, and ſo thereby cauſed the decay of al marchandiſe, compelled the inhabitants through miſery to flee away into other countries. And yet it is apparant, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when any neceſſitie is towards for payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, no money is to be had, in ſuch ſort that the Spaniſhe ſouldiers are at after dele in their payment xxviij. moneths and the Dutch moſt of them conſtrayned to goe a begging from dore to dore: of whiche ſome haue by famine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie periſhed. Notwithſtanding the great ſummes which the ſtates haue leuied &amp; paid to the paying of the ſaid ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and yet neuertheleſſe haue his garniſons conſumed and eaten out the moſt part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townes, and ſuppreſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Seruitio,</hi> which they haue bin forced to miniſter to the ſaid Spaniſh ſouldiers, and thoſe which haue gyuen moſt money, as well to him, as to <hi>Don Frederico,</hi> or any of theirs, haue bin the firſt that were diſcharged of the ſayde bondage of <hi>Seruitio.</hi> With whiche garriſons he hath moſt vexed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townes ſituated within the hart of the countrie: leauing the borders and other places of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce without any gariſon, wherby in ſome places, things are come to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration: beſides that by reaſon of lacke of pay, his Spaniſh ſoldiers are fallen into a moſt licentious and vnſpeakeable order of life, threatning, beating, robbing, ſpoyling, &amp; by all maner of cruell exactions vſing your ſubiects: whereby is manifeſt, that vnder pretence of your Maieſties name and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſetteth nothing but to fyll his greedy and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty appetite, being to the contrary moſt notorious that he hath ſo litle regard to the ſeruice of your Maieſty, as to the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale of the low countries, which he ſuffereth vtterly to periſh and goe to ruine.</p>
            <p>But what nedeth it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> words to expreſſe this, as if he had
<pb facs="tcp:17727:108"/> not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly manifeſted wherunto his proceedings haue tended, ſhewing it being blinded with his moſt vnſatiable preſumpteouſneſſe, and deſire of vaine glory: as in a token of a <hi>Tropheum,</hi> or ſigne of victorie in his notorious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as before rehearſed hath cauſed to be erected within the caſtel of <hi>Andwerpe,</hi> a braſen Image ſtanding vpon the nobilitie and ſtates of the countrye. Wee leaue nowe vnrehearſed what his meaning was thereby, but when, or where, hath it bene ſeege that any Tirant in his life time hath cauſed any ſuch Image to be erected. Wee find that the Romaine Emperours &amp; Kings, which in a maner had brought the whole worlde vnder their ſubiection, haue ſometimes cauſed to be erected Images of braſſe &amp; ſtone: as at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who pretend to he gods vicar, yet it is done by ordinaunce and conſent of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and commons, or at the leaſt by their aduiſe and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce: but that they in their life time haue done ſuch, is not to be found by any examples or Cronicles, conſidering it to be a manifeſt token of madde arrogancie and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable prid. We finde onely that <hi>Nabuchodonozar,</hi> who cauſed himſelfe to be honoured as a God, ſet vp the like I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, commaunding all men to kneele and bowe vnto the ſame: yet durſt hee not do it but by conſent of the chiefe and nobles of his countrie.</p>
            <p>But this Tirant doth aſwel in his preſumpteous arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantie as in execrable tirannie ſurpaſſe all other tiraunts: who as though he woulde not onely aduaunce himſelfe to the roome of theking, but likewiſe in God his place: hathe without the aduiſe, counſell, or ordinaunce of any, in his life time erected this proud Image, to the defacing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of your Maieſties dignity, ſhewing therby his force and tyranny wherewith he hath ſubdued and brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote theſe countries.</p>
            <p>And in like manner he hath not bene afraide, following the example of the tirant Herode: to place himſelfe vppon
<pb facs="tcp:17727:108"/> the market place of <hi>Andwerpe,</hi> in your Maieſties ſtoole and cloth of eſtate: which neuer had bin touched by any Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant before, ſitting there repreſenting the abſence of your Maieſtie, as an Idol, and vnder pretence of publiſhing of a pardon: which neuer Queene, Duke, or any Gouernours or Gouernaunts of theſe countries haue done the like: ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manifeſt diſeſtimation and abaſing of your Maieſties honour and dignitie.</p>
            <p>Theſe proceedings, moſt ſoueraigne king are become ſo apparant and euident vnto all the worlde, that all ſtraunge nations, and Potentates, haue a terrour and execration therat, inſomuch as euen the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> his ſouldiours, and ſeruantes, doe proteſt and ſay, that they can not eſteeme ſuch for good, much leſſe that the ſeruice of your Maieſtie, and welfare of the countrie, ſhould therin conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that we can not thinke that your Maieſtie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therof ſufficiently and truely infourmed, would permit ſuch forces and violences, for it was neuer heard that any King or Potentate, hath ſo vnmercifully dealt with his ſubiects. Your Maieſties auncetours of moſt famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, haue in moſt milde and Gentle maner behaued them ſelues towardes their ſubiectes, that they haue therof giuen a moſt laudable example not only to their ſucceſſours, but alſo to other Chriſtian Princes, Dukes, and rulers, that when ſo euer any diſſention was riſen betweene the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and Magiſtrates, by reaſon of miſgouernement, and taken armes in hande: and being againe brought vnder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by their Lordes and rulers, were neuer moleſted with theſe examples of crueltie, but by expreſſe capitulation from word to word, confirmed all their priuileges and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and the ſame to enioy their full effect.</p>
            <p>So as wee ſhoulde greatly wrong your Maieſtie, if wee ſhould perſwade our ſelues that your Maieſtie were ſo far diuerted from the example of your predeceſſours, and from the duetie of all other Chriſtian Princes and Potentates,
<pb facs="tcp:17727:109"/> that in ſtead of miniſtring right and Iuſ ice to your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubiects, and giuing audience to their moſt pitiful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes, ſhould ſende ſuch a tirant in ſuch ſort crueltie to murther them, deſtroying the country, and burthening your ſubiects w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt intollerable ſlauery, ſeruitude, &amp; thraldom.</p>
            <p>And nowe the ſaide Duke preſenting vnto vs his fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pardons, vnder the name of your Maieſtie, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions and miſdemeanours (as he termeth them) we could not accept the ſame without depriuing of your Maieſties dignitie.</p>
            <p>Knowing wel, that your Maieſtie will not, before ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard the iuſtneſſe of our cauſe, condemne vs of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Where is there any that iuſtly haue informed your Maieſtie of our dealings, or when did euer your Maieſtie giue eare vnto any, but ſuch as were our manifeſt enimies? Reaſon requireth both partes to be hearde, before ſentence ſhould be pronounced. And therefore in the Cronicles of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, is much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended: who whenſoeuer he heard any parties, leaned with his head vpon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with one of his eares cloſed, and being aſked why he ſo did, anſwered that the latter party ought as wel haue audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the firſt, which order hath alwayes bin had in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all nations, as being conformable to all natural rightes. So as no offendour, what greeuous crimes ſoeuer he had committed, ſhal be iudged or condemned, but that he ſhal firſt anſwere vnto ſuch accuſations as are alleged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p>Now moſt mercifull and ſoueraigne Lord and King, we do moſt humbly proſtrate our ſelues vnder the foote of your Maieſtie, moſt hartely requeſting the ſame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would pleaſe your Grace to bend towards vs one eare, &amp; (as in a ballaunce) equally to wey our eſtates. Your Maieſty hath by poſtes letters &amp; other meanes, bin informed of this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t eſtate, &amp; our mouthes haue bin cloſed vp, our tongues pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with red burning Irons, and our lippes ſeared vp with
<pb facs="tcp:17727:109"/> burning tongs, becauſe we ſhuld not giue our neceſſitie to vnderſtand. The waies haue as yet bin taken from vs, ſo that our lamentable cries could neuer come vnto, or pearce the eares of your maieſtie.</p>
            <p>How then can your Maieſtie condemne vs of rebellion (which alwais we haue had in hatred) bicauſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> doth ſeeke to bring vs vnder his ſubiection with his letters of pardon, &amp; we nothing eſteeming of the ſame: which he perceiuing, and that with force he can not (by god his prouidence) preuayle, we cannot therfore accept his ſaid letters, as being direct to vs who neuer ſtrayed from your obedience, except it were that we wold take &amp; acknowledge the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> for our king: for him onely haue we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and not your Maieſty, whom we with life and goods (ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe God to permit vs the ſame) will faithfully ſerue and obey. And therfore his pardon doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touch vs, which tendeth onely to the Townes which haue bin ſeduced from the Kings obedience. But we marke his intent, knowing that either he would be king himſelfe, or elſe that we by enticement of his ſubtile pardons ſhoulde condemne our ſelues. For we receiuing pardon, muſte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelues gilty of commotions &amp; rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our King, of tumult and ſedition, yea of hereſie and declining from the Chriſtian faith, and in fine, to the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the honour of God and the kings Maieſtie. This is his ſeeking, that by receiuing of his falſe and fained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, we ſhould by our ſubſignations &amp; ſeales confirme the ſame, to the intent that he hereafter might therby defend &amp; excuſe himſelfe of tyrannie, before your Maieſtie and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chriſtian Princes and Potentates, ſaying, that if wee had not found our ſelues culpable in theſe greeuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for which we were puniſhed and tormented, we would neuer haue receiued any remiſſe or pardon.</p>
            <p>Wherein wee take God, the ſearcher and knower of all hartes, and your Maieſtie to witneſſe, that if wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:17727:110"/> committed any ſuch offences, as by the ſaid pardon are layd to our charge, that we do altogither refuſe all pardon, but deſire as the moſt wickedſt and vileſt creatures on earth to make ſatiſfaction for our offences with our bloud, and doe not refuſe, O moſt mercifull King, one after another, to ſuffer moſt extreeme torments, if it may be found that wee haue offended in ſuch order as is preſumed.</p>
            <p>And do requeſt the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> (if any petition will take place with him) that all ſuch as come to him for pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, acknowledging the pretended offence, that hee wythout ſhewing of mercy, doe entreate them in ſuch ſorte as their offences (according to right haue) deſerued, commending him therin in giuing or maintayning any faith or credit with him as one ſo vnfaithful to god &amp; his king, as hath not bin abaſhed ſo greatly to abuſe &amp; contemne their maieſties.</p>
            <p>But what is it, it ſhall not be found that euer we haue thought any ſuch matter, much leſſe in effect ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. We haue alwayes bin faithful &amp; ſeruiſable to our King, &amp; ſought to ſerue God, the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in ſpirite and truth, according to his word and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, ſo farre as our feeble nature would permit, euen to the laſt droppe of our bloud.</p>
            <p>But conſidering that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> in ſtead of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting equitie and Iuſtice, and hearing of their complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and greefes, and perſecuting of your Maieſties promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hath contrary to all right and reaſon, &amp; our rightes and priuileges, ſuppreſſed vs with moſt cruel tyrannie, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Countries, and vſed vs more ſeuerely, than euer Iewes or Turkes haue don againſt their vaquiſhed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And in the meane ſpace hath hee accuſed vs to your Maieſtie, and all other chriſtian Potentates with falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of rebellion and hereſie: and we neuer could come to our anſwere, or receiue any comfort in the vniuerſall world. So as by neceſſitie we haue bin forced to take the armes in hand, &amp; by all meanes poſſible ſought to defende
<pb facs="tcp:17727:110"/> our poore natiue Countrey from ſuche execrable tyrannie: and rather with one accord to ſpend our lyues, than to fall into the hands of ſuch a Tyrant: wherin we meane to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, except that it pleaſe your Maieſtie with mercifull eares to attend to our complayntes, and miniſter to vs Iuſtice againſt ſuch oppreſſion and tyrannie. For God be thanked, we are not ſo ill inſtructed in his word, but that we knowe very well, that aſwell our life as deathe conſiſteth in hys hands, and that this death which no man can eſcape, is but as a ready path to the life euerlaſting.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſeeing our death may be a pleaſure to other, we chooſe rather to dye an honorable death in the behalfe of the liberties and common weale of our Countrey, than to fall into ſuch ſeruitude, and become footeſtooles vnto moſte arrogant aliants, who alwayes haue hated vs. For at the leaſt we ſhall therby leaue to our ſuccors ſuch a good fame, as it may be ſayd, that their Predeceſſours had rather with renowne to dye with honour, than lyue in all bondage and ſhame.</p>
            <p>We contende for the libertie of our conſciences, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our wiues and children, our bloud and goodes, that is to ſay, whether the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> with his complices ſhall according to his ſelfe will be a Lord and Gouernour, or that we to the behoofe of your Maieſtie, O moſt Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne King, ſhall defend it from him. We knowe that the limites of our liues are ſet, and ſhall not by the pardon of the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> ſurpaſſe the ſame. Therefore we onely deſire your Maieſtie, that it may pleaſe the ſame to weye and conſider our caſes, and not to ſuffer, that we by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch pardons, ſhoulde for euer be reputed as rebels to God and our King, which we neuer thought.</p>
            <p>For we are fully perſwaded, that although we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued thoſe pardons, yet would it nothing haue preuayled for ſafegard of our lyues, for thereby the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> might haue had the better action againſte vs to proceede
<pb facs="tcp:17727:111"/> with moſt ſeueritie, &amp; might better haue anſwered for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if we had confeſſed our ſelues gilty of rebellion, both againſt God and the King his Maieſtie. For then no man would haue moued vs, although we had bene ſlaine &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered as diſturbers of the peace and common wealth and not worthy to liue.</p>
            <p>And although it were not ſo, yet it is apparant by all the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> hys proceedings, that he meaneth to obſerue no fayth with vs, for ſeeing that he hath openly perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the othe which the Duches of <hi>Parma,</hi> with all the Lords and gouernours of the countrey, in the name of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, had ſworne ſo ſolemnely to theſe townes: yet hath he in theſe latter warres, ſufficiently expreſſed his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe meaning in diuers townes, as at <hi>Monts</hi> in <hi>Henauld</hi> hath he contrary to his othe, cauſed a number of Burge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to bee hanged, at <hi>Naerden</hi> he hath executed his crueltie in ſuch ſort as in a towne of like bignes hath not ben hard of: and now at <hi>Harlem</hi> hath he or at the leaſt in his name, <hi>Don Frederico</hi> aſſured the ſouldiours of their liues, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto certaine Lordes as pledges they bounde themſelues: and yet hath he euen to the young pages: cauſed them to be murthered one with another, and their naked carkaſſes to the ſcandale of all women, and virgins, left lying vpon the ſcaffold a day and a night. And ſuch as had conſented to the deliuery of the towne, &amp; were entred into his ſeruice, hath he cauſed to bee caried to the Galies, and vpon the Fuycke before <hi>Harlem</hi> when he had promiſed the ſouldiours their liues, ſuffred them to periſh with hunger, ſaying: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had aſſured them of their liues, and not of meate and drink. As alſo the Burgeſes of <hi>Harlem,</hi> whom hee had aſſured their liues, hath he compelled to be Myners before the towne of <hi>Alkmer,</hi> where they are by the inhabitantes ſlayne: which doth paſſe all barbarous tiranny and crueltie, and is a moſt manifeſt token wherewith he ſeeketh to maintaine his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true proceedinges.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:17727:111"/>
            <p>So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is euident y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he meaneth not to obſerue any othes or promiſes, but for a ſmall time: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> entent he might the better haue his will of others, &amp; becauſe he might the better hereafter defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his caſe, againſt your Maieſtie, &amp; other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth produce this pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for if we do accept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame we muſt needes acknowledge our ſelues giltie of ſuch offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as he layeth to our charge, &amp; is not bound to the obſeruing of any oth: for by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counſel holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> it was aboue ij. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeres enacted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no faith is to be kept w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heretikes.</p>
            <p>For wheras he doth in his pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubtilly alleadge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuche offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as haue ben co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, were don more vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euil ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; euil will, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their own nature and inclination. This is but a ſubtil pollicie, wherwith he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to deceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimple, &amp; bring them vnder his yoke: &amp; to furniſh himſelf of power to ſuppreſſe all ſuch as he thinketh good, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproch of any, ſeeing that it ſtandeth in his iudgement who hath offended the premiſſes or not.</p>
            <p>But once conſider moſt ſoueraigne King, how that the righteous God hath deceyued this ſubtile dealer in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinges, for in this pardon wherein he pretendeth moſt greeuouſly to accuſe vs, he doeth by expreſſe wordes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that he can by no meanes think that we could not haue bene ſo altered or chaunged, but vppon euill ſuggeſtion, or els wee ſhould haue continewed in all fayth and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which we alwayes haue ſhewed to your Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>For if it be ſo, that we before this laſt offence (as he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it) haue ſhewed to your Maieſtie all obedience as hee himſelfe witneſſeth? Why hath he then vſed ſuch crueltie and perſecution? Wherefore hath he in ſuch ſort deſtroyed the townes, burned the villages, and places: murthered the inhabitantes, and ſpoyled them of all their goodes: hath not he by his ſouldiours by fyre conſumed <hi>Catwicke</hi> vpon Zea, <hi>Sandwicke</hi> and <hi>Alfen,</hi> &amp; that long before theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, whereof hee complayneth, were begon. Did not they pretend to ſet fyre on the towne of <hi>Vtretcht,</hi> which was
<pb facs="tcp:17727:112"/> ſo well addicted vnto them, haue not they in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> whereas they were receyued as friendes, cruelly murdered a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Burgeſes, was there not fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd by <hi>Pachecho</hi> a bil of innumerable number, aſwell of the nobilitie, as moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall commons in ſundry and diuers townes, which by commaundement of the Duke ſhould haue bin murthered, if matters by Gods prouiſion had not altered. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto tended the demaund of the tenth peny, to none other ende but that we ſhould at his hands buy our goodes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he pretended to be confiſcated: wherby it appeareth that he and his adherents are ſworne enimies vnto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: whileſt he doth in ſuch ſort execute his tirannie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, burning, and with ſuche force and ſeruitude, dothe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeue vs your ſubiects, whome he him ſelfe doth alleage to haue bin moſt faithfull vnto your maieſtie. So as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough neceſſitie we haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to enter into armes to reſiſt his force and tirannie: which his ſeruants could not denie, who diuers times haue ſayd that they would ſo long vexe and trouble this countrey and inhabitantes thereof, that in the end they ſhoulde be forced to rebell, and ſo haue occaſion to bring it vnder ſubiection, and ſpoyle the ſame of all their ſubſtance: whiche is to be approued by ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereby was written, that this it was for which they longed. It is very true moſt ſoueraigne King, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke dothe here alleage, as that your ſubiects would neuer had rebelled, but vppon ſuggeſtion of certayne euill diſpoſed, which euill diſpoſed are none other than the Duke hymſelf, with his bloudy counſell, and ſanguine adherents, which of meere ſet euill will, and vnſatiable auarice, haue ſucked the ſweat and bloud of your ſubiects, and of long time ſo earneſtly perſecuted, and greeued to the vttermoſt, that they for defence of themſelues, their wiues, children, and al that whiche in this world they do eſteeme of, haue bin forced to take armes in hand. Therefore where as he preſumeth that he hath ſo louingly dealt with other townes: take example
<pb facs="tcp:17727:112"/> by <hi>Tourney, Valencien, Lyſle, Ipre, Maestricht, Deuenter,</hi> and likewiſe by <hi>Machlin, Oudenard, Dermonde,</hi> &amp; <hi>Naerden,</hi> where they haue by murthering, robbing, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, rauiſhing of wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, &amp; with diuers outrages perſecuted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore commons.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, hath there bene murthered at <hi>Bruxels</hi> at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry tymes aboue CC. and .xxx. Burgeſes, and that long before the beginning of theſe warres, as alſo in a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which happened amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the commons haue bene ſlaine lx. or lxx. beſides an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of men &amp; women, which at ſundrie times haue bene murthered: which wee leaue to enlarge heere, ſeeing thoſe their proceedinges are accompted mercifull dealings, beſides other moſt wicked inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces vſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid townes.</p>
            <p>And therefore he needeth not to threaten vs, that if wee doe not accept his pardon, that no rigour which may bee deuiſed, ſhalbe left vnexerciſed towardes our perſones, by deſolation, hunger and ſword, in ſuch ſorte, as no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ſhalbe left of them preſent For we are certaine, that here about he hath ſought as much as is to him poſſible: and would vndoubtedly haue vſed further crueltie (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he boaſteth ſo much) if the feare which hee hath, that the Countreys would not any longer abyde his crueltie, had not letted him.</p>
            <p>Hee doth not ſo much eſteeme the ſeruice of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, nor regardeth your heritage and countries, as that he would abſtaine from ruining and deſtroying the ſame: yea vtterly to roote out the reliques and memories thereof, ſo farre as it were to him poſſible, as the burning and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating which he before theſe warres, hath vſed, doe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beare witneſſe. But we truſt that the almightie God will neuer ſuffer that your Maieſtie ſhould permit your Countries altogither to fall into the force of ſuch a Tyrant and deſtroyer.</p>
            <p>For, whereas hee here alleadgeth that we haue put on armes agaynſt your Maieſtie: that we vtterly deny. For
<pb facs="tcp:17727:113"/> we proteſt before your Maieſtie, yea before God &amp; his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that our meaning or pretence was neuer ſuch. For we wil adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture our ſelues and all that we haue in this world, as likewiſe we haue done towardes your Maieſties prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, with life and goods to ſtand to the defence of your maieſtie againſt all your enemies and ill willers.</p>
            <p>But this wee will acknowledge before the vniuerſall world, that (being thervnto extremely conſtrained) we haue taken armes in hand agaynſt the tyranny and abuſes of the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> and his complices, to deliuer our liues and goods, wyues and children from the bloudthirſtie hands of his miniſters: and if hee doe preuayle agaynſt vs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to dye an honorable death, and leaue a fame to our ſucceſſours, than to yelde and bowe to ſuche a tyrant, and ſuffer our countrie to liue vnder vnſupportable ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. So els we ſhould be abaſhed and aſhamed to ſhewe our faces in any other Countries, as hauing neglected the ſeruice of your Maieſtie. And therefore haue all the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ioinctly and ſeuerally taken in hand and ſworne the one after the other, to abyde all ſieges, if neede bee, to the vttermoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though to the loſſe of their lyues and goods, yea rather ſet fyre of our owne howſes, than to yelde to the force of this Tyrant.</p>
            <p>For wee are well aſſured, that at the hands of ſuch a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as regardeth no othe, and hath ſo often and cruelly threatned vs, there is no more to be looked for, but that hee would rather colour the riuers &amp; ſtreames with our bloud, and to be hange the countrey with our bodyes, to ſatiate his bloudthirſtie luſt and appetite.</p>
            <p>Therefore we proſtrate our ſelues before the feete of your Maieſtie, deſiring the ſame for God his ſake, who hath ſet the Crowne vppon your head, and giuen the Scepter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hande, once to bowe your eares to our reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble complayntes. Wee doe not deſire to bee diſſolued from the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your Maieſtie, but onely that we may
<pb facs="tcp:17727:113"/> haue our conſciences free to Godwarde, to heare his holy word, and to follow the ſame, to the intent to giue an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt at the day of Iudgement of our ſoules, and that wee may atchieue ſuch diſcharge for our miſerable natiue Countrie, which alwaies hath done ſuch faithful ſeruice to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, from the yoke and bondage of foraine Nations and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldioures, and to ſuffer the Countrie to enioye thoſe liberties, priuileges and cuſtomes, as your Maieſtie, and the moſt puiſſant Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> your Maieſties moſt noble father (of famous memorie) haue to your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſolemnely ſworne.</p>
            <p>Then will we at the commaundement of your Maieſtie lay downe our weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and armes, and wil venture body, goods, and all that we haue in the world, in the ſeruice of your maieſtie by water or by land, where and when ſo euer your Maieſtie ſhall commaund the ſame: and your Maieſty ſhall finde that we are not altered or abaſtarded from you, but rather that we doe excel in faithful ſeruice all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, which hereby we do promiſe and ſweare to your maieſtie, beſeeching euen as we doe faithfully meane it, ſo to take mercy of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Deſiring that this our declaration and othe be openly publiſhed and declared to all Kings, Potentates, Lordes and Nations, to the intent they may knowe that we are no Rebelles towards our King, for we neuer learned ſuch of our predeceſſours: But that we of meere force and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie haue bin conſtrained to take on armes againſt the enemies and vſurpers of his maieſties name.</p>
            <p>Requeſting therfore all chriſten Princes &amp; Potentates, that they wil be moued with a pityfull compaſſion of our miſeries, (and much doubting that this our ſupplication, &amp; declaration ſhall be kept backe and ſuppreſſed, as other our former Requeſtes haue bin, and not come to our Kings handes:) that they wil thereof informe his Maieſtie, to the
<pb facs="tcp:17727:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> maieſtie, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our iuſt cauſe may come to light, &amp; that his Maieſtie may be acquited of the innocent bloud, which this <hi>Albaniſh</hi> Tyrant doth ſhed. This we hartily deſire, and we al wil pray vnto almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for euer.</p>
